Hello, I’m `Abdelkareem Elkhateb`, I like to train deep neural nets on distinct domains, interested in improving current web developements with AI applications.

This blog is where I document my journey to learn about programming, deep learning, and AGI.

Currently I’m Learning `NLP`, `Generative AI`, `Recs`, and `IR` to build charming language models that able to talk, hear and see, made me some coffee

I love building Astro.js websites and powering them with AI, like kam_calorie, Awazly, and more.

My research focuses on Arabic NLP, small model optimization, image denoising, and vector computing.
