2. **Generative AI**: Building generative models for business solutions and creative applications.

3. **Recommendation Systems**: Passionate about personalization—enjoy designing recommendation systems for projects of all sizes.

4. **Information Retrieval**: Working with embeddings and vector databases to improve search and knowledge discovery.

5. **Hypermedia Systems**: Developing small apps with htmx to accelerate AI pipelines, from data processing to observability.
