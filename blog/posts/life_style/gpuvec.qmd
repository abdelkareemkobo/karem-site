## [Cloud GPU Pricing in 2025](https://gpuvec.com)  

In the fast-paced tech world of 2025, cloud GPUs drive AI breakthroughs, machine learning, and high-performance computing (HPC). Whether you’re training large language models (LLMs) or tackling vision tasks, finding the **best cloud GPU providers** at the right price is critical. With varied pricing from platforms like CoreWeave and Hyperstack, the landscape can feel overwhelming. That’s where **GPUvec** shines—your go-to hub for **cloud GPU pricing comparison**, **GPU benchmarks**, and tools like our **model size calculator**.

### Why Cloud GPU Pricing Matters  

**Cloud GPU pricing** can define your project’s success. From startups to enterprises, demand for scalable, cost-effective GPUs is surging. Providers like Hyperstack offer NVIDIA H100s at $1.90/hr, while others compete with flexible rates for AI workloads. But it’s more than hourly costs—VRAM, CUDA cores, and hidden fees (storage, networking) shape true value. GPUvec cuts through the noise, spotlighting the **cheapest cloud GPUs** and high-performance options tailored to you.
