## Why Were All My Domains Suspended?
I have one simple question: If one of my domains has copyright issues—for example, one of my websites is about house cleaning services—why would you shut down 11 domains across different niches? These include:

1. GPU Information
2. Arabic Food Calories
3. Gym Supplements
4. Paint Colors
5. House Services
6. Personal Blog

How do you explain this to me? It’s completely acceptable to shut down one domain and notify me with a message explaining what I did wrong, with some respect. But to send me an email stating that my account is suspended and then have all my domains taken offline? Why? Really, why?

I can’t accept this. I’ve spent two years learning SEO and web development to earn money, and my main job is research. This is my only source of income, and you suddenly take it all away!

I know I didn’t steal content from anyone. I know what I’m writing about. If there’s anything related to AI, let Google’s team handle it! Give me a warning—anything—but to wake up and find myself in debt to people I rented articles to for listing their phone numbers? That’s insane!

I remember counting the money, planning what I’d do next... but to wake up to this email, without any respect or explanation? Are you kidding me?
## I can't accept what happend!

My life and my hard work are not under your control for someone behind a screen to decide to shut down my account for doing nothing—literally nothing! This will deeply affect my life in the coming two months. I know I’ll be able to move on, but I will have lost a lot.

I won’t let this go unaddressed. I know that in two or three years, I’ll be recognized for my work in AI, my contributions to research, and the innovative projects I’m building. My bio will include, “Hostinger Doesn’t Respect Its Customers...”

Finally, don’t put all your eggs in one basket, and don’t trust Hostinger with anything.
