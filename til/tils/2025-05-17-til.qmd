## Why TIL ?

It helps you overcome the perfacationsim in writting. 
you don't need to create great article in depth about things you want to share or learn about..etc, all what you want it to write a thing you were trying to learn or solve 
today and how you solve it

which will help me more focused and make the process of learning more easier and useful for me and others

## create your own gravitey 

sometimes you want to reach and communicate with people in the same space of problems you are solving,
search engines are very bad in provide the information you want..this is related to how these engines work and other SEO stuff. but for me, i can't reach people and help them or get benefit from them 
because they simple don't know about me!!

TIL will decreases this spaces and daily TIl about the things  i am learning which are alot will start to give me nice SEO and unique because i am talking about things i don't know and i am interested in and there will be much people in the same boat
this will increase my X account and linkedin and this is very useful in the current time. 

## TILs level up 

I also want to think in way to extract more crafted blogs from my TILs. 
but just start making it habbit and will see who will it comes in the end. 

initial thoughts:
1. weekly recap from my TILs and SEO optimization for the keywords that is increasing and i am interested in
2. ML to extract related stuff, for example i will want to take about the folloinwg topics:
- Late interaciton (Pylate, Colbertv2, ColPali)
- Searching 
- Model2vec
- Visino Language models..etc
collecting them and start writing about them and adding internal links for them will be very useful to improve my blog system 


## Things i learned the last 2 days

### The best way to increase traffic is comment with valuble knowledge. 
I was scorlling on X and found some popular account tweets about Harvard CS197 AI Research and i had create a review year ago about it
I add the link in the comment and just slept. 
Boom i found reply analytics links opened wihtout annoying anyone!!
- 501 Impressions
- 77 Engagements
- 2 profile visits
- 74 clicks

## What is PALID index?

PLAID index is for indexing very large datasets with Later interaction models like (Colbertv2 & ColPali)
IT Solves the storage footprint and allow you to scale to infinity

They swapped the faiss from facebook what is nice thing because i have multiple bad time to install it especially the GPU version. 

and used fastkeamns from the amazing @bclaive which i really like his work on embeddings

It's replacement for Voyager-based HNSW index which was very bad for scaling Late-Interaction retrieval  models

## Prime Intellect VS  Gpuvec

I was creating a website to find and compare the cloud compute instances from all cloud providers in easy and interactive way. 

I started to work on it the last month, but stoped for other work. 

suddenly i found this website which is called Prime intellect. 

And i just want to say,woooooow. 
it's a piece of art. 
The design and information on it and how fast, accurate is very embrassing for my poor gpuvec.com

should i continue improve my website?

Actually yes, we share similar goals but there is multiple chances to compete or even collaborite!! who knows!

They are more than just listing and compare prices, then enable you to use these GPUs from their website. 

Also they create decentralized models and have a mutliple expirened engineers.
