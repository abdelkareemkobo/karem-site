I tried every Hindi video about this problem and gave it to specialists to try it, but in vain, the problem happened again and again.\nThe solution: It was my first year at a computer science college, so the geeky thing was to use Linux. After some search, I installed Ubuntu and then tried a lot of distros like Void Linux, but the one that I picked and still use is the amazing PopOS! which is based on Ubuntu but better than it!\nThe WiFi problem doesn’t appear again! And for Nvidia graphics, it’s solved in PopOS! which has a command to install some drivers. And everything works smoothly\n\n\nThe Cost of It!\nI bought it for the cost of 20,000 EGP, which at the time I bought it was $X, but now 20,000 EGP is worth $XX due to problems in my country.\nIts cost at that time is really high for my budget and family, but I insisted on buying it because I knew it would stay with me for years, so I wanted a good one.\n\n\nHow I Decided to Buy It!\nThe phrase “Machine learning needs an Nvidia GPU” was dancing in my mind, so my main focus was on a nice GPU card in a laptop with a low budget. After some search, I found that the best choices are MSI or Lenovo, but the Lenovo version cost about 4000 EGP more than the MSI.\n\nI tested the keyboard of the Lenovo, and every time I felt like I wanted to cut my fingers off\n\nIt wasn’t available online, so I had to travel 3 hours to the store that sells it. It was a nice experience to buy something I wanted instead of a random gift from my father."

What you need here is enough GPU RAM - in my case it’s a 6GB card. This worked fine with computer vision algorithms and classic NLP models with less than 1 billion parameters. There’s no chance to try the LLAMAS models on such a card!\nEvaluate a model means to just load the model and not fine-tune it.\n\nI was fine with all the ML tasks I tried to do, unless I opened the door to large language models like the GPT family (ChatGPT for example). These models require a lot of memory and need a good graphics card like an RTX 30 or 40 series to test, and there’s no chance to train these models on any RTX card!\n\nWhy Not Just Use the Cloud!\nThere are two main solutions:\n\nKaggle\n\nKaggle has two GPU options, and I used it a lot, especially if the data was already hosted on Kaggle and was more than 10GB. Other than that, I downloaded a sample of the data and did my work on my own environment with CLI commands and VS Code configurations. This helped me a lot compared to just using the Kaggle editor, and it’s faster too! Sometimes the Kaggle kernel panics or just stops responding entirely!\n\nColab\n\nColab restarts after 4 hours and your work can get lost, and lots of annoying things like that happen a lot.\nYou have to pay for the GPU version. You get a number of hours to try it out, and it’s faster than my GTX 1660 by a good margin.\n\n\nBut I didn’t love these cloud solutions, and I found having my own local setup to be faster and more comfortable."

For each sentence in the first set, the best match in the second set needs to be found.\n\nThe matches are commonly translations.\nThe Provided model i used to embed each sentence and the closest pairs are found via cosine similarity\nF1 serves as the main metric for bitext mining.Accuracy, precision and recall are also computed. #definition Classification\nA train and test set are embedded with the provided model.\nThe train set embeddings are used to train a logistic regression classifier with 100 maximum iterations, which is scored on the test set.\nThe main metric is accuracy with average precision and f1 additionally provided. #definition Clustering Given a set of sentences or paragraphs, the goal is to group them into meaningful clusters.\nA mini-batch k-means model with batch size 32 and k equal to the number of different labels is trained on the embedded texts.\nThe model scored using V-measure - V-measure does not depend on the cluster label,thus the permutation of labels does not affect the score. #definition Classification A pair of text inputs is provided and a label needs to be assigned. Labels are typically binary variables denoting duplicate or paraphrase pairs.\nThe two texts are embedded and their distance is computed with various metrics (cosine similarity, dot product, euclidean distance, manhattan distance).\nUsing the best binary thresh- old accuracy, average precision, f1, precision and recall are computed.\nThe average precision score based on cosine similarity is the main metric. #definition Reranking : Inputs are a query and a list of relevant and irrelevant reference texts. The aim is to rank the results according to their relevance to the query.\nThe model is used to embed the references which are then compared to the query using cosine similarity.\nThe resulting ranking is scored for each query and averaged across all queries.\nMetrics are mean MRR@k and MAP with the latter being the main metric. #definition Retrieval Each dataset consists of a corpus, queries and a mapping for each query to relevant documents from the corpus.\nThe aim is to find these relevant documents.\nThe provided model is used to embed all queries and all corpus documents and similarity scores are computed using cosine similarity. After ranking the corpus documents for each query based on the scores, nDCG@k, MRR@k, MAP@k, precision@k and recall@k are computed for several values of k. nDCG@10 serves as the main metric.\nMTEB reuses datasets and evaluation from BEIR (Thakur et al., 2021). #definition Semantic Textual Similarity (STS) Given a sentence pair the aim is to determine their similarity. Labels are continuous scores with higher numbers indicating more similar sentences.\nThe provided model is used to embed the sentences and their similarity is computed using various distance metrics.\nDistances are benchmarked with ground truth similarities using Pearson and Spearman correlations.\nSpearman correlation based on cosine similarity serves as the main metric (Reimers et al.,2016). #definition Summarization A set of human-written and machine-generated summaries are provided. The aim is to score the machine summaries. The provided model is first used to embed all summaries. For each machine summary embedding, distances to all human summary embeddings are computed. The closest score (e.g. highest cosine similarity) is kept and used as the model’s score of a single machine-generated summary. Pearson and Spearman correlations with ground truth human assessments of the machine-generated summaries are computed. Like for STS, Spearman correlation based on cosine similarity serves as the main metric\n\n\n#sidenote Non-Transformers : LASER (Heffernan et al.,2022) is the only context aware non-transformer model we benchmark, relying on an LSTM (Hochreiter and Schmidhuber, 1997) instead. Similar to LaBSE, the model trains on parallel data and focuses on bitext mining applications. ![[Pasted image 20231028124555.png]]"

    "text": "Analysis\n\nwe observe that there is considerable variability between tasks. No model claims the state-of-the-art in all seven English tasks.\nThere is even more variability in the results per dataset present in the appendix.\nFurther, there remains a large gap between self-supervised and supervised methods.\nSelf-supervised large language models have been able to close this gap in many natural language generation tasks (Chowd- hery et al., 2022).\nHowever, they appear to still require supervised fine-tuning for competitive em- bedding performance.\nWe find that performance strongly coorelates with model size, A majority of MTEB tasks are domainted by multi-billion parameter models.However, these come at a significant cost\nFor classification\n\nST5 models dominate the classification task across most datasets\nST5-XXL has the highest average performance, 3% ahead of the best non-ST5 model, OpenAI Ada Similarity\n\nClustering\n\nDespite being almost 50x smaller, the MPNet embedding model is on par with the ST5- XXL state-of-the-art on Clustering. This may be due to the large variety of datasets MPNet (and MiniLM) has been fine-tuned on.\nClustering requires coherent distances between a large number of embeddings.\nModels like SimCSE-sup or SGPTnli, which are only fine-tuned on a single dataset,NLI, may produce incoherent embeddings when encountering topics unseen during fine-tuning.\nRelatedly, we find that the query embeddings of SGPT-msmarco and the Ada Search endpoint are competitive with SGPT-nli and the Ada Similarity endpoint,respectively.\nWe refer to the public leaderboard5 for Ada Search results. This could be due to the MSMARCO dataset being significantly larger than NLI.\nThus, while the OpenAI docs recommend using the similarity embeddings for clustering use cases6 , the retrieval query embeddings may be the better choice in some cases.\n\nPair Classification\n\nGTR-XL and GTR-XXL have the strongest performance. Pair classification is closest to STS in its framing, yet models rank significantly differently on the two tasks. This highlights the importance of benchmarking on a diverse set of tasks to avoid blindly reusing a model for a different task.\n\nReranking\n\nMPNet and MiniLM models perform strongly on reranking tasks.\nOn SciDocsRR (Co-han et al., 2020a) they perform far better than big- ger models, which is likely due to parts of SciDocsRR being included in their training data.\nOur scale of experiments and that of model pre-training make controlling for data contamination challenging.\nThus, we ignore overlap of MTEB datasets with model training datasets in MTEB scores.\nAs long as enough datasets are averaged, we believe these effects to be insignificant.\n\nRetrieval\n\nSGPT-5.8B-msmarco is the best em- bedding model on the BEIR subset in MTEB as well as on the full BEIR benchmark (Thakur et al., 2021; Muennighoff, 2022).\nThe even larger 7.1B SGPT model making use of BLOOM (Scao et al., 2022) performs significantly weaker, which is likely due to the multilinguality of BLOOM.\nModels geared towards STS (SimCSE, ST5, SGPT- nli) perform badly on retrieval tasks.\nRetrieval tasks are unique in that there are two distinct types of texts: Queries and documents (“asymmetric”), while other tasks only have a single type of text (“symmetric”).\nOn the QuoraRetrieval dataset, which has been shown to be largely symmetric (Muennighoff, 2022), the playing field is more even with SGPT-5.8B-nli outperforming SGPT- 5.8B-msmarco,\n\nSTS & Summarization\n\nRetrieval models (GTR, SGPT-msmarco) perform badly on STS, while ST5-XXL has the highest performance.\nThis highlights the bifurcation of the field into separate embedding models for retrieval (asymmetric) and similarity (symmetric) use cases (Muennighoff, 2022)."

This will help anyone in a similar position as me in the future.\nWhen studying a topic and knowing that I can write about it on my blog, I find my mind more focused on details that would fit well in the blog.

Using noise-cancelling headphones or heading into outer space would be ideal environments with no bothersome sounds around."

I then tested the noise-cancelling feature and was amazed when I couldn’t hear my younger brother calling me.\nThe street noises were effectively blocked out, with only a faint hum reaching my ears, which was quite tolerable. Initially, the earbud tips were a bit uncomfortable, but after switching to a smaller size, the discomfort was resolved. Everything seemed perfect, except for a slight pressure in my ears when using the noise-cancelling feature, particularly noticeable the following morning. Despite this, my ears seem to crave the earbuds and my skin seems to miss them when they’re not in use. This can be a bit of a downside, but it’s not always the case."

    "text": "Is noise cancelling actually work ?\nI’ve used these earbuds in various settings:\n\nSubway: The noise-cancelling feature combined with my music created an immersive experience, effectively blocking out any other sounds and allowing me to enjoy my tunes in peace.\nCollege: Amidst the chatter and shouts of other students, I was able to retreat into my own world of sound.\nBus: The noise of the bus engine was successfully blocked out, but I could still hear the conversations of those sitting next to me. It wasn’t overly bothersome, but it didn’t provide complete isolation.\n\nIn summary, the noise-cancelling feature works well, but it doesn’t provide absolute silence. I can still hear some ambient sounds. One noticeable issue is that when I make calls using the earbuds, I can hear the other person clearly, but they often complain about the clarity of my voice. They say it sounds distant and unclear, sometimes even asking to call back later. This issue is particularly prevalent when I’m on the bus."

    "text": "the modes of the Freebuds and\nHere is a rephrased version of the key points about the Huawei Freebuds 5i’s features:\nNoise Cancellation Modes:\n\nNoise Cancelling Mode: Actively cancels out ambient noise. Uses more battery power.\nOff Mode: No active noise cancellation, but still provides some passive noise isolation. Less battery usage.\nAwareness Mode: Allows ambient sounds to be heard clearly. Useful for hearing announcements at the gym or people talking to you. However, my own voice sounds muted in this mode, so I have to remove the earbuds temporarily to hold conversations.\n\nSound Quality Presets:\n\nDefault: No sound enhancements applied.\nTreble Boost: Boosts treble frequencies. I haven’t used this.\nBass Boost: Emphasizes bass when listening to music like hip-hop.\nVoices: Optimizes sound for speech clarity. I use this for podcasts.\n\nConnection Priority Modes:\n\nBalance Mode: Balances audio quality and connection stability.\nSound Quality Priority: Prioritizes sound quality over connectivity. Uses more power which may cause occasional lag.\n\nI have not noticed any discernible difference between these two modes, so I just use the Balance mode."

The press and hold gesture is a bit slow, and the triple-tap gesture can be annoying since tapping your ear three times isn’t very comfortable.\nOccasionally, the Freebuds don’t recognize when I’ve inserted the left or right earbud, and I continue listening with just one earbud without realizing the other isn’t connected. This doesn’t happen often, though."

They come with an IP54 rating, making them dust-tight and splash-resistant. The color options include a new “Isle Blue”, along with “Nebula Black” and “Ceramic White”. The package includes small, medium, and large silicone eartips, as well as a short USB-C cable for charging the case.\nI love the sound of closing it, it’s a loud sound but lovely :)"
