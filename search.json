If AI can replace an engineer’s mind, it will replace everything in the world.\nWhen this happens, it won’t really matter!\nI got my first job one year after graduation with a good salary for my experience and the local currency.\nالحمد والشكر والفضل لله وحده.\nActually, I got two jobs, not one!\nI landed a full-time AI Engineer position at a startup that is already operational with its own customers, plus a part-time role with flexible meetings. I’m the wildcard—maybe even the AI—in this startup, which is set to receive funding in the coming weeks.\nThis might give the impression that I’m a great engineer, but I’m not!\nI’m not good at programming; I’m below average and can barely do cool stuff on my own. I only know some solutions to try, and I’m familiar with multiple resources and places to get help. I love asking more experienced people for feedback.\nI can only say that I love this field a lot! It’s very interesting. With just a laptop and my mind, I can create things the world needs and will pay for!\nThis may sound silly, but it’s an amazing idea to think about, especially for someone like me who doesn’t enjoy the outside world or dealing with people in real life.\nWhat I like is that the world is connected, and you can gain recognition quickly if you’re doing real work and building connections with people in your field.\nI’m interested in Machine Learning and focus on niche areas where not many people are working. In my language, there’s little competition, which gives me a unique edge! But in reality, I’m below average; the basics I explore in these areas are enough for now.\nI don’t advise anyone to do this, but I want to say that when you try your best, reflect on your goals, start crafting your ideas, and engage with others’ ideas, your influence and impact will grow significantly.\nI’ve met many ordinary people who simply read documentation, ask questions about what they don’t know, and are beginners, yet others look at them and think, “Wow, they must be geniuses!”\nBut they’re not! You may have more knowledge and experience than them, but business, your birthplace, and the college you graduated from are strong factors in determining your path.\nYou can reach great places without these, but they accelerate your progress!\nWe all know the story of the child who learned programming at 11 years old and now, at 25, codes as easily as walking.\nWhat I’ve found is that you can still build great connections with someone who has 10 years more experience than you, and they might even say, “You’re a smart person! I want you to work with me.”\nWe’re all limited, and there will always be gaps that require other minds to fill. The great thing is that we grow faster when we connect with such minds!\nI really admire the work from the AnswerDotAI team. I find that Jeremy Howard has a profound impact on how I think about AI and learning.\nThe courses I’ve taken with him, the community, and the tools make me feel ahead of the curve and capable of creating things!\nWhen you start following people like Omar Khatab, Benjamin, Antoine, Tom Arson, and many others, and interact with their work, you begin to gain weight in these spaces. I’m not just talking about getting a job—I’m talking about the level of ideas.\nThere are people watching, people building tools around concepts, and people creating new concepts!\nI wish I could reach the cutting edge of knowledge. This may not be precise, but I see it as a journey I want to pursue.\nThere’s more to say, but this world has immense potential for smart people—not in terms of marketing or being a shallow influencer.\nI want to say that I have many ideas I want to create and share with other minds. I believe I’ll be able to make a positive impact in the areas I’m passionate about and improve Islamic tech and Arabic NLP."

I am not good at writing or English, but I am trying to do my best. Communication is a very important skill for my work as a researcher.\nI build products I want people to learn more about…more later.\nI have services I want to market…more later.\n\nDid you forget something?\n^_^\nDie, empty, and publish your knowledge!\nActually, the main reason for me to write is that I feel lonely in my journey of learning about DL and software engineering.\nAnd I feel bored most of the time.\nI love the feeling that I am writing and archiving my life. This reminds me that I am doing hard work, learning new things, and my life will not end without doing great things from my point of view.\nRecapping what I learned when I write about it makes the concepts stick in your mind, and you get more insights from people’s comments. This is very helpful for me.\nFor readers, you can see what I do, and you may be interested in it, be inspired, and learn from my mistakes.\n\nFollowing the Giants?\nWhen I started learning about DL, I searched for a great book about DL and PyTorch that is well explained in both code and theory.\nI found his Substack where he publishes what he learns. At the same time, I found similar people like\n\nJay Alammar\nMaarten Grootendorst\nPaul Iusztin\n\nThese people I follow and appreciate what they provide!\nSo I started to ask, why do they use Substack?\nThe answer is very clear if you know them ^_^\n\n\nQuick analysis\nThe UI/UX, speed of the website, and animations are very cool.\nLet’s look at the level I want to reach :)\n\nAhead of AI\nOn 28/04/2023\nIt reached 15,028 free subscribers and only 69 paid ones!\nThis is very disappointing for me.\nYou don’t know if these are monthly or yearly paid and how much they give.\nOf course, I don’t know how much he earns or others. I want to motivate myself and not create high expectations. He is doing great stuff, really great. His content is in the top 5 for me for AI and real content.\nNo scams, no “read this paper,” “look at this book,” “here are the top 1000 chatbots that are better than 10 who are better than GPT!!”\nOh my god, QwenClaudeMixtral just released a model that will convert space into water in the year 1021932103120931920.\nThis is very silly if you respect your readers’ minds!\n\n\n\nAhead of AI subscribers in 2024\n\n\nWhat about now?\nHe has more than 105k+ and is #71 Rising in Technology. I don’t know why 71!! He must be top 5.\nJay Alammar =&gt; 23k+ subscribers\nMaarten Grootendorst =&gt; 20k+ subscribers\nPaul Iusztin =&gt; 25k+ subscribers\nMost likes per post are around 10 to 20 only!\nThe comments are around 0 to 5 :)\n\n\n\nMy Goal in the coming 6 months?\nI am doing multiple things at the current time.\nI am on 4 projects and doing my Master Thesis and a lot of projects and websites I am developing.\nI will not be able to provide much, but I will try my best.\nI don’t care about the number of subscribers, I care about real ones, who will comment and read the content. If I can get 30 people to read it, this is great. Really, if you imagine 30 people in your room watching what you did, it’s mind-blowing. Imagine 300 or 3,000…Wow.\nFor money, if I can get only $200 per month, this is very great as a start.\n\nDisease from other websites?\nI noticed the following issues on the first day:\n\nSh*** shorts and copyright issues: By copyright, I mean some people take others’ content from outside Substack and post it as if it is their own and get followers for this! This is very bad. I don’t like strict copyright like “you copied this sentence” or “used a logo,” but stealing the whole content!!!\nVery short articles compared to normal tweets! I found a lot of articles that appeared to me are like tweets…I thought I was in a place where people write in-depth content, not clickbait.\n\nI don’t talk about the post but the long-form ones.\n\nDrop your Substack fake numbers: A lot of people post “drop your Substack below and whatever it’s about I will exchange” and multiple similar things!! What is the\npurpose then… you have 1 million subscribers, then what?\n\n\n\nThere is no official API for Substack\nThe most annoying thing in Substack is there is no current API to develop apps, create extensions, and automate a lot of things.\n\n\n\nWhat things can I write about?\nYou seem to love to talk a lot? What will you write then?\nIt’s very obvious…\nI want to talk about the following:\n\nCompute world with AI, fine-tuning/training, and cloud instances, etc.\nProducts I use and tried, not product reviews.\nBooks and papers I read and summarized.\nTILs, what I learned today!\nNovel writing about the AI world like vector databases, embedding, and searching, etc.\nApplications I build and services I provide.\nMy workflow and software i use.\nSubstack tips and analysis.\n\nyou can find links here for now: 1.

    "section": "What is RAPTOR RAG? Complete Guide to Meta’s RAPTOR Technique",
    "text": "What is RAPTOR RAG? Complete Guide to Meta’s RAPTOR Technique\n\n\n\nraptor rag\n\n\nRAPTOR RAG is Meta’s innovative technique designed to improve document retrieval performance. While they claim a 20% improvement, my testing shows mixed results depending on the use case.\n\nUnderstanding RAPTOR RAG\nRAPTOR stands for “Recursive Abstractive Processing for Tree-Organized Retrieval.” It’s a tree-based approach that constructs hierarchical representations of your documents by recursively clustering text chunks based on their vector embeddings and generating summaries of those clusters.\nThe core innovation is building a tree structure from the bottom up, which helps solve the fundamental limitation of traditional RAG systems: retrieving only a few short, contiguous text chunks that limit their ability to represent large-scale discourse structure.\n\n\nThe Problem RAPTOR RAG Solves\nTraditional RAG systems struggle with thematic questions that require integrating knowledge from multiple parts of a document. This is particularly relevant for complex queries like understanding an entire book or analyzing long-form content.\nExample: Consider the fairy tale of Cinderella and the question “How did Cinderella reach her happy ending?” Traditional RAG’s top-k retrieved short contiguous texts won’t contain enough context to answer this comprehensively.\n\n\nHow RAPTOR RAG Works\nRAPTOR solves this by using a tree structure to capture both high-level and low-level details about text. The process involves:\n\nClustering text chunks based on semantic similarity\nGenerating summaries for each cluster using language models\nRepeating the process recursively to build a hierarchical tree\nTree-based retrieval during query time\n\n\n\nModel-Based Summarization in RAPTOR\nAfter clustering nodes using Gaussian Mixture Models, each cluster is sent to a language model (typically GPT-3.5-turbo) for summarization. This step transforms large chunks of text into concise, coherent summaries, condensing potentially large volumes of retrieved information into manageable sizes.\n\n\nQuerying RAPTOR RAG\n\n\n\nquery RAPTOR rag\n\n\nRAPTOR supports two main querying approaches:\n\nTree Traversal - Navigate through the hierarchical structure\nCollapsed Tree Retrieval - Flatten the tree for faster retrieval\n\n\n\nRAPTOR RAG Performance Analysis\nWhile the 20% improvement claim is appealing, my testing reveals some limitations:\n\nAccuracy gains are marginal compared to SBERT-based solutions\nComputational overhead is significant for creation and retrieval\nBest use case is document summarization rather than question answering\nInformation flow can be repetitive in some scenarios\n\n\n\nRAPTOR RAG for Document Summarization\nThe most compelling use case for RAPTOR is document summarization. By having detailed, medium, and high-level information representations, you can create better summaries by:\n\nDividing the summarization task across multiple levels\nPre-computing summaries at different granularities\nReducing the burden on the final LLM for summary generation"

    "text": "DFloat11: Efficient, Lossless Compression for LLMs\nDFloat11 (DF11) is a novel, mathematically lossless compression technique that reduces large language model memory usage by about 30% with zero accuracy loss. Unlike traditional quantization methods that can degrade model quality, DF11 uses Huffman coding to compress only the predictable exponent bits of model weights.\n\nHow DFloat11 Works\n\n\n\nDFloat11 encoding\n\n\nDFloat11’s compression strategy is elegant in its simplicity:\n\nSign and Fraction Bits: Kept unchanged as they contain high-entropy information\nExponent Bits: Compressed using a precomputed Huffman tree, replacing the fixed 8-bit exponent with variable-length codes\nAverage Savings: About 5 bits per weight on average\n\n\n\nDFloat11 Storage and Decoding\nStorage Architecture: - Sign/fraction and exponent bits stored separately - Small header containing the Huffman codebook - Efficient packing for minimal overhead\nRuntime Decoding: - Original weights quickly reconstructed by combining sign/fraction block with decoded exponent - Enables fast, parallel processing on GPUs - No performance penalty during inference\n\n\nDFloat11 Key Benefits\n\n30% reduction in model size compared to bf16\n100% identical accuracy to the original model\nUniversal applicability to any transformer-based LLM\nZero training required - works with existing models"

Average is affected with the outliers so, if one task is the low the final answer with be low also.\nBut from the first look, we can see the peformance is similar to the Arabic versions of MiniLM-L12 in Average and if you looked at the Sentence similarity for STS22 it’s score are very good compared to static-embedding model.\n\nUnderstanding MTEB Tasks for Arabic\nThe Massive Text Embedding Benchmark (MTEB) evaluates embedding models across various tasks. Here’s a breakdown of the tasks used :\n\nMIRACLRetrievalHardNegatives: Measures retrieval accuracy for hard negative examples, critical for search and question-answering systems. Zarra’s lower score here reflects its static embedding nature, which sacrifices some contextual nuance.\nMLQARetrieval: Tests retrieval performance on multilingual question-answering datasets, where Zarra performs comparably to MiniLM models.\nSTS17 & STS22: Evaluates semantic textual similarity, where Zarra excels, particularly in STS22, with scores rivaling larger models.\nXNLI: Assesses natural language inference, where Zarra’s performance is competitive despite its compact size.\n\nThese tasks highlight Zarra’s strengths in semantic similarity and efficiency, making it ideal for applications like chatbots and lightweight search systems\nYou can see the peformance for every task in MTEB here\n\n\n             Sorted by MIRACLRetrievalHardNegatives_main (Score)

faster and capable of running on CPU.\nThis makes Bojji an excellent lightweight alternative for applications requiring efficient Arabic embeddings.\nAlso the models performance is most of the time better than the potion-multilingual-128M which indicates that techniques are working with any language not just English.\n\n\nArabic RAG Leaderboard\nTo complement MTEB evaluations, I tested Zarra on the Arabic-RAG Leaderboard, which provides a robust benchmark for Arabic-specific tasks. Zarra ranks 37 out of 45 models with an average score of 36.84.\nThis is impressive, as Zarra is the smallest model in the leaderboard, highlighting its efficiency and competitive performance in resource-constrained settings.\n\nWhat about Bojji perfomrance in Arabic RAG Leaderboard?\nActually the first model with Zarra and not bojji is the second release of Zarra with different updates but..i know that if i didn’t write the blog as it as, i will not publish it again!\nBojji will be test on the Arabic Rag soon."

    "text": "Unlocking SEO Potential with NLP: A Journey of Website Optimization\nIn the vast digital landscape, the visibility of a website amidst the sea of search results can make or break its success. Search Engine Optimization (SEO) stands as the beacon guiding businesses towards the shores of higher visibility and traffic. As the digital realm evolves, so do the strategies employed to enhance SEO. One such frontier that holds immense promise is the integration of Natural Language Processing (NLP) into SEO practices.\n\nUnderstanding the Landscape\nSEO isn’t just about optimizing keywords anymore; it’s about understanding user intent, predicting trends, and delivering value-rich content. Harnessing the power of NLP, we embark on a journey to revolutionize SEO practices for our websites. Here’s how we’re leveraging NLP to bolster our SEO efforts:\n\n\n1. Daily Downloads and Keyword Integration\nWe kickstart our journey by integrating Google Search Console into our workflow. By fetching daily downloads of our top queries, we gain invaluable insights into user behavior and preferences. These queries are seamlessly integrated into a specific folder, forming the backbone of our content optimization strategy.\n\n\n2. Content Analysis and Optimization\nNLP comes into play as we meticulously analyze our content to ensure alignment with the top queries identified. By leveraging NLP techniques, we ascertain the presence of these keywords within our content, ensuring relevance and resonance with our audience’s search intent.\n\n\n3. Predictive Analytics and Trend Spotting\nPowered by NLP, we delve into the realm of predictive analytics to forecast future trends. By analyzing historical data and current patterns, we identify emerging trends and capitalize on them proactively. This enables us to stay ahead of the curve and position our content strategically to meet evolving user demands.\n\n\n4. Semantic and Exact Match Integration\nNLP empowers us to delve deeper into the semantics of language, enabling us to differentiate between exact matches and similar meanings. Through advanced NLP algorithms, we ensure that our content not only features exact keyword matches but also resonates with synonymous terms, enhancing its visibility across diverse search queries.\n\n\nLeveling Up the Game\nAs we progress on our journey of NLP-driven SEO optimization, we outline a roadmap for leveling up our capabilities:\n\nLevel 1:\n\nData Management: Implementing robust data storage solutions tailored to multiple websites.\nVisualization: Crafting compelling visualizations using tools like Bokeh and Plotly.\nMachine Learning Models: Developing forecasting models to predict future trends.\nSemantic Search: Leveraging vector databases for semantic and exact search capabilities.\n\n\n\nLevel 2:\n\nOptimization: Streamlining our codebase through asynchronous processing and caching mechanisms.\n\n\n\nLevel 3:\n\nProduct Development: Exploring avenues to transform our NLP-driven SEO framework into software products like WordPress plugins or desktop applications.\n\n\n\nLevel 4:\n\nInnovation: Drawing inspiration from industry leaders to create bespoke solutions, such as an Arabic version of our SEO platform akin to UberSuggest and Guni Rank.\n\n\n\n\nConclusion\nI mainly using NLP with python to improve my landing pages for home services like the following services: Here are the markdown links with target titles for the provided text:\n\nمنصة صناعة المحتوي العربي\nكم كالوري في الموز\nصيانة افران غاز بالرياض\nشركة تنسيق حدائق بالمدينة المنورة\nشركة تنظيف منازل في العين\n\nIn the ever-evolving landscape of SEO, the integration of NLP marks a paradigm shift towards more sophisticated and nuanced optimization strategies. By harnessing the power of NLP, we not only decipher the language of search but also anticipate and cater to the evolving needs of our audience. As we continue to refine our approach and explore new frontiers, the synergy between NLP and SEO promises to redefine the digital landscape, empowering businesses to thrive in an era of unparalleled connectivity and discovery. you can read more articles here"

This is slow and inconvenient—I don’t like having to open my phone often. Most of the time, my meals are repetitive, and recording them on the Huawei Health app is boring, so I usually just do a quick add.\nIn the future, I hope they let us add a list of meals to the app so we can select them directly from the watch."

I spoke to her again shortly after, and she asked me for specific information about the watch to check if it was under warranty or not. She followed up with me two days later, then again a day after that, and again two days later until I managed to get the invoice from Amazon. She tried to solve the issue by recommending an exchange and even told me which day to go when there would be discounts on the products.\nHonestly, it was the best customer service experience I’ve ever had. She was able to go beyond being just a robot to become someone who understands, values, and helps—a human experience that brings joy.\nAt the very least, I had to document and acknowledge that she is someone exceptional. I requested to give her a rating, and I did. I’m really happy about that.\nBut I haven’t fixed the watch yet because there are no spare parts available in Egypt."

    "text": "First impressions\n\nUpon unboxing and using it for the first time, I was genuinely pleased with the initial track I played.\nThe sound quality was noticeably superior compared to my phone or any other earbuds I’ve previously used. I then tested the noise-cancelling feature and was amazed when I couldn’t hear my younger brother calling me.\nThe street noises were effectively blocked out, with only a faint hum reaching my ears, which was quite tolerable. Initially, the earbud tips were a bit uncomfortable, but after switching to a smaller size, the discomfort was resolved. Everything seemed perfect, except for a slight pressure in my ears when using the noise-cancelling feature, particularly noticeable the following morning. Despite this, my ears seem to crave the earbuds and my skin seems to miss them when they’re not in use. This can be a bit of a downside, but it’s not always the case."

    "text": "Is noise cancelling actually work ?\nI’ve used these earbuds in various settings:\n\nSubway: The noise-cancelling feature combined with my music created an immersive experience, effectively blocking out any other sounds and allowing me to enjoy my tunes in peace.\nCollege: Amidst the chatter and shouts of other students, I was able to retreat into my own world of sound.\nBus: The noise of the bus engine was successfully blocked out, but I could still hear the conversations of those sitting next to me. It wasn’t overly bothersome, but it didn’t provide complete isolation.\n\nIn summary, the noise-cancelling feature works well, but it doesn’t provide absolute silence. I can still hear some ambient sounds. One noticeable issue is that when I make calls using the earbuds, I can hear the other person clearly, but they often complain about the clarity of my voice. They say it sounds distant and unclear, sometimes even asking to call back later. This issue is particularly prevalent when I’m on the bus."

Uses more battery power.\nOff Mode: No active noise cancellation, but still provides some passive noise isolation. Less battery usage.\nAwareness Mode: Allows ambient sounds to be heard clearly. Useful for hearing announcements at the gym or people talking to you. However, my own voice sounds muted in this mode, so I have to remove the earbuds temporarily to hold conversations.\n\nSound Quality Presets:\n\nDefault: No sound enhancements applied.\nTreble Boost: Boosts treble frequencies. I haven’t used this.\nBass Boost: Emphasizes bass when listening to music like hip-hop.\nVoices: Optimizes sound for speech clarity. I use this for podcasts.\n\nConnection Priority Modes:\n\nBalance Mode: Balances audio quality and connection stability.\nSound Quality Priority: Prioritizes sound quality over connectivity. Uses more power which may cause occasional lag.\n\nI have not noticed any discernible difference between these two modes, so I just use the Balance mode."

For each sentence in the first set, the best match in the second set needs to be found.\n\nThe matches are commonly translations.\nThe Provided model i used to embed each sentence and the closest pairs are found via cosine similarity\nF1 serves as the main metric for bitext mining.Accuracy, precision and recall are also computed. #definition Classification\nA train and test set are embedded with the provided model.\nThe train set embeddings are used to train a logistic regression classifier with 100 maximum iterations, which is scored on the test set.\nThe main metric is accuracy with average precision and f1 additionally provided. #definition Clustering Given a set of sentences or paragraphs, the goal is to group them into meaningful clusters.\nA mini-batch k-means model with batch size 32 and k equal to the number of different labels is trained on the embedded texts.\nThe model scored using V-measure - V-measure does not depend on the cluster label,thus the permutation of labels does not affect the score. #definition Classification A pair of text inputs is provided and a label needs to be assigned. Labels are typically binary variables denoting duplicate or paraphrase pairs.\nThe two texts are embedded and their distance is computed with various metrics (cosine similarity, dot product, euclidean distance, manhattan distance).\nUsing the best binary thresh- old accuracy, average precision, f1, precision and recall are computed.\nThe average precision score based on cosine similarity is the main metric. #definition Reranking : Inputs are a query and a list of relevant and irrelevant reference texts. The aim is to rank the results according to their relevance to the query.\nThe model is used to embed the references which are then compared to the query using cosine similarity.\nThe resulting ranking is scored for each query and averaged across all queries.\nMetrics are mean MRR@k and MAP with the latter being the main metric. #definition Retrieval Each dataset consists of a corpus, queries and a mapping for each query to relevant documents from the corpus.\nThe aim is to find these relevant documents.\nThe provided model is used to embed all queries and all corpus documents and similarity scores are computed using cosine similarity. After ranking the corpus documents for each query based on the scores, nDCG@k, MRR@k, MAP@k, precision@k and recall@k are computed for several values of k. nDCG@10 serves as the main metric.\nMTEB reuses datasets and evaluation from BEIR (Thakur et al., 2021). #definition Semantic Textual Similarity (STS) Given a sentence pair the aim is to determine their similarity. Labels are continuous scores with higher numbers indicating more similar sentences.\nThe provided model is used to embed the sentences and their similarity is computed using various distance metrics.\nDistances are benchmarked with ground truth similarities using Pearson and Spearman correlations.\nSpearman correlation based on cosine similarity serves as the main metric (Reimers et al.,2016). #definition Summarization A set of human-written and machine-generated summaries are provided. The aim is to score the machine summaries. The provided model is first used to embed all summaries. For each machine summary embedding, distances to all human summary embeddings are computed. The closest score (e.g. highest cosine similarity) is kept and used as the model’s score of a single machine-generated summary. Pearson and Spearman correlations with ground truth human assessments of the machine-generated summaries are computed. Like for STS, Spearman correlation based on cosine similarity serves as the main metric\n\n\n#sidenote Non-Transformers : LASER (Heffernan et al.,2022) is the only context aware non-transformer model we benchmark, relying on an LSTM (Hochreiter and Schmidhuber, 1997) instead. Similar to LaBSE, the model trains on parallel data and focuses on bitext mining applications. ![[Pasted image 20231028124555.png]]"

    "text": "Analysis\n\nwe observe that there is considerable variability between tasks. No model claims the state-of-the-art in all seven English tasks.\nThere is even more variability in the results per dataset present in the appendix.\nFurther, there remains a large gap between self-supervised and supervised methods.\nSelf-supervised large language models have been able to close this gap in many natural language generation tasks (Chowd- hery et al., 2022).\nHowever, they appear to still require supervised fine-tuning for competitive em- bedding performance.\nWe find that performance strongly coorelates with model size, A majority of MTEB tasks are domainted by multi-billion parameter models.However, these come at a significant cost\nFor classification\n\nST5 models dominate the classification task across most datasets\nST5-XXL has the highest average performance, 3% ahead of the best non-ST5 model, OpenAI Ada Similarity\n\nClustering\n\nDespite being almost 50x smaller, the MPNet embedding model is on par with the ST5- XXL state-of-the-art on Clustering. This may be due to the large variety of datasets MPNet (and MiniLM) has been fine-tuned on.\nClustering requires coherent distances between a large number of embeddings.\nModels like SimCSE-sup or SGPTnli, which are only fine-tuned on a single dataset,NLI, may produce incoherent embeddings when encountering topics unseen during fine-tuning.\nRelatedly, we find that the query embeddings of SGPT-msmarco and the Ada Search endpoint are competitive with SGPT-nli and the Ada Similarity endpoint,respectively.\nWe refer to the public leaderboard5 for Ada Search results. This could be due to the MSMARCO dataset being significantly larger than NLI.\nThus, while the OpenAI docs recommend using the similarity embeddings for clustering use cases6 , the retrieval query embeddings may be the better choice in some cases.\n\nPair Classification\n\nGTR-XL and GTR-XXL have the strongest performance. Pair classification is closest to STS in its framing, yet models rank significantly differently on the two tasks. This highlights the importance of benchmarking on a diverse set of tasks to avoid blindly reusing a model for a different task.\n\nReranking\n\nMPNet and MiniLM models perform strongly on reranking tasks.\nOn SciDocsRR (Co-han et al., 2020a) they perform far better than big- ger models, which is likely due to parts of SciDocsRR being included in their training data.\nOur scale of experiments and that of model pre-training make controlling for data contamination challenging.\nThus, we ignore overlap of MTEB datasets with model training datasets in MTEB scores.\nAs long as enough datasets are averaged, we believe these effects to be insignificant.\n\nRetrieval\n\nSGPT-5.8B-msmarco is the best em- bedding model on the BEIR subset in MTEB as well as on the full BEIR benchmark (Thakur et al., 2021; Muennighoff, 2022).\nThe even larger 7.1B SGPT model making use of BLOOM (Scao et al., 2022) performs significantly weaker, which is likely due to the multilinguality of BLOOM.\nModels geared towards STS (SimCSE, ST5, SGPT- nli) perform badly on retrieval tasks.\nRetrieval tasks are unique in that there are two distinct types of texts: Queries and documents (“asymmetric”), while other tasks only have a single type of text (“symmetric”).\nOn the QuoraRetrieval dataset, which has been shown to be largely symmetric (Muennighoff, 2022), the playing field is more even with SGPT-5.8B-nli outperforming SGPT- 5.8B-msmarco,\n\nSTS & Summarization\n\nRetrieval models (GTR, SGPT-msmarco) perform badly on STS, while ST5-XXL has the highest performance.\nThis highlights the bifurcation of the field into separate embedding models for retrieval (asymmetric) and similarity (symmetric) use cases (Muennighoff, 2022)."

    "text": "The Centrality of Math in AI Research\nIt’s true that in both engineering and research, you can be an excellent software engineer and earn a substantial income without deep mathematical knowledge, possibly more than many mathematicians. However, to be a good researcher, a strong mathematical foundation is crucial. By that, I don’t just mean a superficial understanding of numerous topics. You need a solid grasp of linear algebra and probability, both theoretically and practically. And by “practical,” I mean the ability to translate mathematical concepts into code.\nOf course, other topics are relevant, depending on your specific field. For example:\n\nGenerative AI: You’ll often encounter differential equations and advanced probability and statistical models.\n\nAfter reading research papers, you begin to see recurring concepts like conditional probability, Bayes’ theorem, and matrix factorization. But you’ll also find complex, novel, or sometimes even older, techniques that are hard to grasp initially.\n\nIn my limited time exploring research, I’ve observed that many papers lack significant contributions. Some seem to be primarily workarounds, comparisons of existing models, new data applied to established models, or minor observations. This isn’t inherently bad, but it’s not the kind of impact I’m aiming for. The researchers who are making substantial contributions are often very skilled in both math and coding. They create open-source projects, share their ideas, and actively contribute, like the authors of the Colbert papers in information retrieval. And these contributions are often enabled by math, such as PCA, LORA, and other optimization techniques.\nWhile a strong coding background can certainly be beneficial for optimization and research, I strive for a deeper understanding and to reach a higher level of impact. After all, we only have one life.\nI don’t consider myself a “bookworm,” but I genuinely love reading and can become engrossed in books on diverse subjects and levels. I recall reading around four books on linear algebra, completing all the exercises, and summarizing the content. In deep learning, I’ve tackled more than 30 books. For areas like networking, databases, and data structures, I’ve read at least three books on each. When new topics like federated learning, XAI, and adversarial networks emerge, I always read at least one book on each.\nIf you were to examine my profile, CV, GitHub, or even this blog, you’d probably find that I’m below average for a recent graduate! What’s the problem?\nI believe the core issue is that while I’ve read extensively and sometimes coded along with the material, I haven’t committed to projects that demand more time and mental effort. I haven’t really allowed the knowledge to “grow.” For instance, I learned linear algebra theory and did the pen-and-paper exercises, but I didn’t experiment with coding it. And, I didn’t apply the concepts I studied to the fields that truly interested me. There’s also a gap between the libraries we use in deep learning and the underlying skills – they don’t always feel directly connected.\nIt’s unrealistic to understand every library at a micro-level. But it’s crucial to try and bridge the gap between your fundamental skills and the high-level APIs you use. For example, challenge yourself to implement PCA from scratch with NumPy on a Kaggle dataset. Try coding the matrix components of LORA with PyTorch. Take probability concepts and apply them to datasets you care about – for me, that might be datasets related to fitness or Arabic language processing. Build projects you love using these new tools, and consciously choose what skills to prioritize. For example, I might be okay with letting go of some discrete math knowledge, but not linear algebra."

    "text": "The Days of Problem Solving\nDuring my second year, I began exploring problem-solving but initially struggled with platforms like Codeforces. However, after two months of encouragement from friends, I decided to give it another shot.\nI was using Edabit to practice Python problem-solving with easy problems and then moved to Codeforces without a solid grasp of C++. It took time and many hours struggling with error messages (I once learned a painful lesson that “” and ’’ are different in C++ unlike Python!).\nAfter about two months of this, my skills in both thinking and implementation improved dramatically. I recall one of my earliest achievements was writing a 300-line C++ solution without relying on Google, and of course, LLMs weren’t around at that time. This feeling of self-sufficiency was incredibly rewarding. After four months, my problem-solving skills had improved considerably, and I had reached the next level. However, I then decided to shift my focus to web development to improve my financial situation, and I never went back. I also remember failing a technical interview in my third year because I struggled to solve linked list problems in Python, despite being able to do so in C++. I felt lost throughout my college years\nBut that feeling of deep understanding, of being able to solve problems independently, is amazing and builds confidence. It’s a virtuous cycle."

    "text": "Things I Remember\nI’m revisiting linear algebra and realized I’d forgotten how to calculate eigenvalues, though I understand their role. However, I haven’t forgotten how to calculate the determinant of a 2x2 or 3x3 matrix. Why? Because I solved countless exercises with determinants, but with eigenvalues, I had primarily read the solutions or tried simple examples. When using PCA in code, it’s easy to rely on a library and not think about the underlying operations. While that’s okay to some degree, we should occasionally revisit how things work behind the scenes."

They’ve scheduled an exam in 7 days from when I applied, and today was the first day I started preparing.\nI completed the linear algebra and probability specializations on Coursera taught by Luis G. Serrano. While it was a good refresher, I dislike relearning the same concepts every year! The exam will cover probability, linear algebra, calculus, algorithms, trigonometry, optimization, and some NLP questions.\nI honestly don’t remember much about trigonometry, and when I studied it before, it was in Arabic, not English, and the transition isn’t so simple. I also dislike cramming things for two days only to forget them immediately after – that feels like a waste of time.\nDespite the odds, I’m determined to apply, even if the acceptance rate for the scholarship is only 5%. Working with the people at MBZUAI would be a great experience. If I’m not accepted, I’ll continue to focus on mastering math and keep moving forward."

I start reading the first the page and the author was talking to me and the words touch my soul deeply for example some qoutes from the book I will write them in arabic and you can translate them with GPT.\nTranslations of the Arabic Quotes (with slight interpretations for clarity):\n\n“ولكن ثمة عامل له في نفسي حفاوة خاصة ، عامل يفسر كثيرا من فشل الطموحات و الأحلام … هذا العامل بكل اختصار: هو أن الخطط فوق الصخور و الارجل مازالت ناعمة ما حفيت بعد…”\n\nTranslation: “But there is a factor that resonates deeply within me, a factor that explains much of the failure of ambitions and dreams… This factor, in short, is that the plans are laid on rocks, but our feet are still tender, not yet calloused.”\nInterpretation: This emphasizes the gap between grand plans and the lack of practical experience or the “hard knocks” that build resilience and skill.\n\n“إذا كان المرء ينام حتي تجهرك أشعة الحمرة في عينية و يبسط خوان الطعام كلما اشتهي ، ويخصص الأوقات الطويلة للقهوة و الشاي و العصائر و الفطائر ، ولا يسمح لنفسه بأن تتنازل عن أي فرصة فسحة أو مسامرات مع أصحابة ، و لا يستطيع كبح جماح تصفح الإنترنت أن يسرق ساعاته ، اذا كان المرء كذلك .. وما زال يرجو ان تتحقق يوما ما خططه العلمية و الدعوية و الإصلاحية ، فمثل هذا الشخص قد استأصل عقله ، و زرع بدلا منه مصباح علاء الدين”\n\nTranslation: “If a person sleeps until the red rays of the sun glare in their eyes, lays out a feast whenever they desire, dedicates long periods to coffee, tea, juices, and pastries, never allows themselves to miss an opportunity for leisure or socializing with friends, and cannot restrain themselves from internet browsing stealing their hours—if a person is like this and still hopes that their scientific, religious, or reformist plans will one day be realized, then such a person has removed their mind and planted Aladdin’s lamp in its place.”\nInterpretation: This strongly condemns a life of indulgence and procrastination, suggesting that those who wish to achieve great things must sacrifice leisure and work diligently. They cannot expect to magically fulfill ambitions like Aladdin with his lamp.\n\n“لا يستطاع العلم براحة الجسم”\n\nTranslation: “Knowledge cannot be attained with bodily comfort.”\nInterpretation: This is a concise statement emphasizing the necessity of effort and sacrifice in the pursuit of learning.\n\n“الكمالات كلها لا تنال إلا بحظ من المشقة و لا يعبر إليها إلا علي جسر من التعب”\n\nTranslation: “All perfections are not achieved except through a portion of hardship, and they cannot be crossed except on a bridge of fatigue.”\nInterpretation: This highlights that excellence and mastery require sustained effort, difficulty, and resilience.\n\n“تلمح فجر الأجر يهن ظلام التكليف”\n\nTranslation: “You perceive the dawn of reward makes the darkness of duty pale.”\nInterpretation: This suggests that the hope of reward and the meaningful impact of your work make the hard work and sacrifice worthwhile.\n\n“بقدر ما تتعني تنال ما تتمني”\n\nTranslation: “To the extent that you exert yourself, to that extent you will achieve what you desire.”\nInterpretation: This is a direct statement of the relationship between effort and achievement.\n\n“ولم تعطني الأيام نوما مسكنا ألذ به ، إلا بنوم مشرد”\n\nTranslation: “The days have not given me a comforting sleep more delicious than a scattered one.”\nInterpretation: This beautifully evokes the idea that true rest is often earned by hard work and might not always be the most comfortable.\n\n“و اذا كانت النفوس كبارا تعبت في مرادها الأجسام”\n\nTranslation: “If the souls are great, the bodies will toil in pursuit of their desires.”\nInterpretation: This highlights that ambitious goals require a commitment to hard work that will test the physical body.\n\n“وكذلك يحذر من التنقل من كتاب الي كتاب من غير موجب فإنه علامة الضجر وعدم الفلاح”\n\nTranslation: “Likewise, he warns against moving from book to book without a valid reason, for it is a sign of boredom and lack of success.”\nInterpretation: This advises against haphazardly abandoning study materials, highlighting that deep learning comes from thorough exploration.\n\n“وإن من الحكمة أن من ابتدأ بعمل وارتاح له فليستمر عليه ، فمن بورك له في شئ فليلزمه ، وبعض الناس يبدأ الأعمال و لا يتممها ، فيمضي عليه الوقت سبهللا من غير فائدة فمثلا يقراء في هذا الكتاب او هذا الفن ، ثم يدعه من غير ان يكمله وينتقل الي غيره ، ثم الي اخر ، من غير تكميل الأول فيضيع عمله وينقضي عمره بلا فائدة ، وكذلك في الأعمال الاخري كل يوم له عمل وكل عمل له راي فيضيع الوقت عليه من غير فائدة” - Translation: “And it is wisdom that whoever begins a work and finds comfort in it should continue with it. For whoever is blessed in something should stick to it. And some people begin tasks and do not complete them, so their time passes in vain without benefit. For example, they read in this book or this discipline and then leave it without completing it and move on to another and then another without completing the first, so they waste their work and their lives pass without benefit. And likewise in other works, each day has a work and each work has its own approach, so they waste time on that without benefit.”\n\nFor opensource project i have a lot of coold projects that i strated and will start soon but didn’t complete any one yet and i know when i finish one i will get a job easly but this is what happend."

    "section": "Imam Al-Nawawi",
    "text": "Imam Al-Nawawi\nAl-Nawawi began his pursuit of knowledge relatively late, in the year 649 AH. He was, as he himself stated, 19 years old at that time. This was considered a late start compared to the custom of their time, where people would begin seeking knowledge before reaching puberty. As Al-Nawawi himself said, “When I was nineteen years old, my father brought me to Damascus in the year forty-nine, and I resided in the Rawahiyya School.”\nAl-Nawawi, may God have mercy on him, passed away in the year 676 AH, at the age of 45. Scholars in their forties typically begin to produce their most refined and meticulously researched scholarly work. Thus, the Sheikh, may God have mercy on him, did not live long.\nWell then… when did the Sheikh begin writing and authoring? The Sheikh himself stated that he spent six years in the pursuit of knowledge, and then began authoring, i.e., he began authoring at the age of 25.\nAl-Nawawi also informed his student, Ibn al-Attar:\n“He mentioned to me, may God have mercy on him, that he did not waste any time, night or day, except in a task of engaging with knowledge. Even while walking on the streets, he would engage in reviewing what he had memorized or studying. He remained engaged in acquiring knowledge in this manner for about six years, and then he began writing.”\nThis means that most of Al-Nawawi’s works that we circulate today were authored during his twenties and thirties!\nAl-Isnawi explains: “This phenomenon with Sheikh Muhi al-Din al-Nawawi was quite common. It is that, when he became qualified to study and acquire knowledge, he saw that it was part of his striving towards good deeds to make what he acquired and understood into an authorship, from which the reader could benefit. Thus, he made his authoring a means of acquiring knowledge, and his acquiring knowledge a means of authoring. Without this, he would not have been able to produce the amount of authorship he did. He entered Damascus to study when he was eighteen years old, and died before he reached forty-six.”\nAl-Isnawi’s point is that Al-Nawawi made his authoring a way to acquire and seek knowledge. He immediately put his seeking and acquiring of knowledge into the form of authorship, i.e., his notes during his pursuit of knowledge, he would convert them into a form of authorship, rather than allowing the notes of his youth to be wasted.\nWas this a coincidence for Al-Nawawi, or was it a conscious behavior? Meaning, did Al-Nawawi keep in mind the benefit of authorship in educating the author himself? In fact, there is a statement of Al-Nawawi in his other book, Sharh al-Muhadhab, which reveals that his early attention to authorship was for the purposes of self-learning. In his introduction, where he explained the etiquette of a seeker of knowledge, Al-Nawawi stated:\n“One should pay attention to ‘authoring’ when one is qualified for it, for through it one discovers the realities and subtleties of knowledge, and it becomes established in one’s mind. It forces one to engage in extensive searching, studying, investigating, and reviewing, and to become acquainted with the different opinions of the Imams, their agreements, what is clear, what is ambiguous, what is authentic, what is weak, what is eloquent, what is feeble, what is not subject to objection, and what is. Through this, a researcher takes on the qualities of a mujtahid (one who can exercise independent legal reasoning).”\nHere, Al-Nawawi is not just encouraging authoring, but he is revealing the motivations that drive authoring and expands on the effect it has on the advancement of the student’s understanding by obliging them to delve deeply.\nAlso, Al-Khatib Al-Baghdadi said: “Whoever wants to benefit, let them break the pen of copying and take up the pen of research.”\n\nAnd I’ve noticed that a lot of prominent figures in Deep Learning (DL) are doing this. For example:\n\nMichael Lanham (https://www.amazon.com/stores/author/B07BPS6WQL): The author of:\n\nEvolutionary Deep Learning\nPractical AI on the Google Platform\nLearn Python Game Development with ChatGPT\nand many other books.\n\nChristoph Molnar (https://christophm.github.io/interpretable-ml-book/): The author of Interpretable Machine Learning.\nChristopher M. Bishop (https://www.amazon.com/stores/Christopher-M.-Bishop/author/B001IGLMNY?ref=ap_rdr&isDramIntegrated=true&shoppingPortalEnabled=true#): The author of the famous book, Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning. He once mentioned that he wrote this book to ensure his own understanding of these concepts.\n\n… and the list goes on.\nMy Approach: Building, Not Just Reading\nI don’t necessarily aspire to write a book, but rather to recreate knowledge from the sources I’ve studied (books, courses, and papers). I don’t advocate for simply “writing a book” as a goal. Instead, I aim to create accessible pieces of knowledge that I can iterate on and use to help others understand these concepts.\nThis is my intended approach, and I will start with:\n\n“Building DL from Scratch” Series: Based on the fastai course and the Deep Learning from Scratch book.\n“Math Level Up for DL”: Based on multiple books, courses, and some experiments I want to conduct.\n\nThen, I will expand on these approaches in blog posts and other materials on topics like federated learning and other areas I’m interested in. I’ll try my best to do all of this effectively."

    "text": "Make It Hard for People to Reach You\nAm I going to live in a cave? No! In a recent meeting, a friend jokingly called me “our search engine.”\nI want to stay connected to what matters and gain maximum benefits without fracturing my attention with short posts or inauthentic interactions.\nThere’s freedom in posting something without expecting comments or reactions. If you like it, great! If not, that’s fine too. Why didn’t you like it? Maybe it’s beginner-level or poorly written. I’ll do better next time.\nI’ve set boundaries to manage interactions:\nDon’t send me voice notes—write instead. It’s quicker, and I don’t have to pause everything to listen.\nDon’t call me—send a message first.\nDon’t leave comments—email me instead.\nTough? Sure. Some people might not like it, but it filters out noise and preserves what’s important. People may get annoyed initially, but they adapt quickly."

That’s where RSS comes in. I love it—it’s a superpower! When I first learned about RSS in college, I pictured an old Englishman in a garden reading about obscure topics. Now, I’ve become that “old man” who craves calm, minimal, and boring tools.\nYou can even follow YouTube channels via RSS without opening a browser! \nFor interacting with people, Discord channels are better. I can still reach folks like Jeremy and Tom there."

    "section": "Introduction to Federated Learning",
    "text": "Introduction to Federated Learning\nDefinition: Federated Learning (FL) enables machine learning models on distributed data by moving the training to the data, instead of transferring data to the training center.\nFL was first developed by Google in 2016 for their Gboard application, which uses a user’s typing history to suggest corrections and predict upcoming words while preserving user data privacy.\nThe idea is as follows: distribute our model across Android users’ applications, train their data locally on their phones, and then aggregate the knowledge each user has learned using aggregation algorithms like FedAvg to combine the updates into a single global model.\nThis process must be repeated for multiple rounds to allow the model to learn from these small updates."

We’ll create a base flavor that everyone recognizes, plus special flavors with unique ingredients—some containing vitamin C, others a dose of caffeine.\n\n\n\nPersonalization in Federated Learning\n\n\nIn FL, this is called personalization. It can be seen as fine-tuning our global model (the base taste) with local data (special flowers) to meet specific needs.\nSince these unique flavors are likely to appeal only to certain local customers, they won’t be as popular with all customers compared to the base taste.\nOur personalized model will excel on local data but may underperform on general data due to increased bias from fine-tuning.\nAn FL system allows us to manage the trade-off between user-specific preferences and generalization."

    "text": "Why FL instead of Centralized Machine Learning?\n\nCentralized Learning lacks security, making FL essential for industries like banking and healthcare.\nPrivate data availability surpasses public data, offering more insights and patterns to uncover new abilities.\nUser preference: Some users expect that no data will leave their device. For example, entering passwords or credit card information should not send those details to a keyboard app’s server. This use case led to FL’s development.\nRegulations: Various data privacy laws (GDPR, CCPA, etc.) protect sensitive data from being transferred. Regulations may even prohibit organizations from merging their users’ data across different countries.\nReduced Compute Costs: Centralized ML with large datasets demands high computational resources, limited by individual machine performance.\nFaster Training: With FL, models can train immediately after receiving data, providing users with faster, more responsive solutions."

    "text": "MSI vs Lenovo\n\nMSI with Linux\nAfter buying it, it wasn’t configured with Windows, but was another DOS version so I had to install a Windows version on it. After 1 week I get a lot of errors on it with the external monitor and the WiFi stops working or is not configured. I tried every Hindi video about this problem and gave it to specialists to try it, but in vain, the problem happened again and again.\nThe solution: It was my first year at a computer science college, so the geeky thing was to use Linux. After some search, I installed Ubuntu and then tried a lot of distros like Void Linux, but the one that I picked and still use is the amazing PopOS! which is based on Ubuntu but better than it!\nThe WiFi problem doesn’t appear again! And for Nvidia graphics, it’s solved in PopOS! which has a command to install some drivers. And everything works smoothly\n\n\nThe Cost of It!\nI bought it for the cost of 20,000 EGP, which at the time I bought it was $X, but now 20,000 EGP is worth $XX due to problems in my country.\nIts cost at that time is really high for my budget and family, but I insisted on buying it because I knew it would stay with me for years, so I wanted a good one.\n\n\nHow I Decided to Buy It!\nThe phrase “Machine learning needs an Nvidia GPU” was dancing in my mind, so my main focus was on a nice GPU card in a laptop with a low budget. After some search, I found that the best choices are MSI or Lenovo, but the Lenovo version cost about 4000 EGP more than the MSI.\n\nI tested the keyboard of the Lenovo, and every time I felt like I wanted to cut my fingers off\n\nIt wasn’t available online, so I had to travel 3 hours to the store that sells it. It was a nice experience to buy something I wanted instead of a random gift from my father."

    "text": "Kobo for ML\n Machine learning is a wide area, and you can use the GPU for 3 things:\n\nTrain a model from scratch\nFine-tune a model\nEvaluate a model (inference)\n\n\nTrain a model from scratch was an ideal task for such a GPU, but I was doing it for multiple computer vision classification tasks, learning new architectures, trying to build…etc. For ML you don’t always need a GPU but for deep learning, which is a subset of ML that uses more connected layers (which means more computing power and memory needs), you do.\nFine-tune a model is the case I used the most - I download a trained model and try to make it work better on my data. What you need here is enough GPU RAM - in my case it’s a 6GB card. This worked fine with computer vision algorithms and classic NLP models with less than 1 billion parameters. There’s no chance to try the LLAMAS models on such a card!\nEvaluate a model means to just load the model and not fine-tune it.\n\nI was fine with all the ML tasks I tried to do, unless I opened the door to large language models like the GPT family (ChatGPT for example). These models require a lot of memory and need a good graphics card like an RTX 30 or 40 series to test, and there’s no chance to train these models on any RTX card!\n\nWhy Not Just Use the Cloud!\nThere are two main solutions:\n\nKaggle\n\nKaggle has two GPU options, and I used it a lot, especially if the data was already hosted on Kaggle and was more than 10GB. Other than that, I downloaded a sample of the data and did my work on my own environment with CLI commands and VS Code configurations. This helped me a lot compared to just using the Kaggle editor, and it’s faster too! Sometimes the Kaggle kernel panics or just stops responding entirely!\n\nColab\n\nColab restarts after 4 hours and your work can get lost, and lots of annoying things like that happen a lot.\nYou have to pay for the GPU version. You get a number of hours to try it out, and it’s faster than my GTX 1660 by a good margin.\n\n\nBut I didn’t love these cloud solutions, and I found having my own local setup to be faster and more comfortable."

    "text": "Definition: SEO is optimizing your website pages to appear in the top results of search engines like Google and Bing.\n\nWhy is this important? It makes you visible to more people who are interested in what you provide—products, services, news, etc.\nEnough of the basics. I assume you already know what SEO is about. Now, let’s explore a darker side of being involved in SEO.\n\nHow to Track Your Changes\n\nSince SEO revolves around ranking, how do you track your position?\nThere are multiple tools I enjoy using, such as:\n\nI love to manually search keywords and track their ranks myself! :)\n\nI do this often when I need a break at the gym or during study breaks.\n\nSEMrush\n\nI use it to check domain authority, organic keywords, and traffic increase.\nSeeing green in increased Ref. Domains and Authority Score brings joy.\nI don’t use it for anything else! :)\n\nRanking Math\n\nSay hi to the overrated WordPress SEO plugin “Ranking Math SEO”\nIt claims to simplify content optimization with built-in suggestions based on widely-accepted practices.\nI use Rankmath Pro on a website I manage, showing impressions, total keywords, average position, and clicks. GSC offers all this for free!\nThis post isn’t about Rankmath; that’s for another time. In short:\n\nAI tools\nAMP\nAnalysis from Google Analytics\nInstant indexing\nBacklinks count\nLocal SEO\nNews sitemap\nPodcasts\nSchema\nSEO analysis\nSitemap\nVideo Sitemap\nWooCommerce\nGoogle Web Stories\n\nNone of these significantly impact SEO and ranking; there are other effective methods.\nWhat matters most to me with Rankmath is:\n\nTop 5 performing posts\nOther keywords\n\nI mainly use Rankmath for its focus keyword section in each article.\n\nMangools\n\nMy preferred tool! Its UI/UX is excellent, and it’s fast and efficient unlike other tools.\nWith the free account, I get:\n\n5 keyword researches daily\n8 SERP checks\n1,000 backlink analyses\nDomain profile checks for 2 domains daily\n\nFor Arabic, its keyword ideas aren’t as good.\n\nGoogle Search Console\n\nA free tool by Google offering most SEO tools’ functionalities for free and accurately.\nYou get:\n\nPerformance of your website for any keyword at any time in any region!\nPage indexing status\nBacklink analysis\nPage experience and more\n\nYou might notice a recurring theme:\n\nCharts\nChanging numbers everywhere, numbers galore!\n\n\nNeil Patel\n\nRank tracking\nSEO opportunities\nSite audit\nKeyword research\nTraffic estimation\nBacklinks\n\nKeyword Tool\n\nFor Arabic, it provides the most related suggested keywords, though many aren’t quite relevant.\n\nGuinRank\n\nNew and more tailored for Arabic, gaining power.\nI use its content and keyword tools for Arabic, providing helpful recommendations and statistics for choosing useful keywords.\n\nMoz\n\nThey even blocked my IP -__-\n\n\n\nStarting to Lose!\n\nWhat’s going wrong? I hate losing after investing time, money, and mental health into something. If you’re like me, SEO can be crushing.\n“SEO is like gambling” ~ Kareem\n\n\n\n\n\nHow to recover form SEO addiction\n\n\n\nLosing Backlinks\n\nSpam backlinks (like Khamsat, Fiverr, and Upwork)—most are harmful.\nPBN Network\n\nThis service claims safe PBNs for backlinks from Web 2.0 blogs, profiles, social bookmarking, social likes/shares, etc. I tried it, and none appeared in GSC after 3 months; worse, my site’s rank dropped.\n\nManually Added Backlinks\n\nThis package offers 70 PR10 backlinks from foreign websites, 60 Arabic guest posts, and 10 EDU backlinks, etc.\nIt worked to some extent, but the impact was minimal. Four backlinks from specific places helped more than these services.\n\nOther services are mostly spam backlinks; some guest posts might help, but aim for real backlinks spaced out from related sites.\n\nLosing Ranking\n\nThis month, a home services website I manage improved from 65th to 9th in rankings, then disappeared, and later ranked 40th, etc.\nThis cycle repeats—a page gains rank, then drops.\nIt’s stressful; don’t check daily. Weekly (or every 2-3 weeks) is less stressful and gives fairer results, focusing on what’s important.\n\nWhat’s Going Wrong?\n\nWatching page changes from these tools is like social media’s new “like” button!\nMy mind loves the green and red numbers.\nUltimately, most analyses aren’t critical. Whether 23rd or 80th, if not in the top 5, what’s the use? Daily checks yield nothing; reaching top 5 goes unnoticed until notifications and calls confirm it.\nIf SEO is your sole income source, it’s a tough job—even though it can make you a millionaire sometimes.\n\nHow to Recover\n\nHere’s what helped me recover from this addiction:\nCreate barriers for easy access:\n\nSeparate Google accounts/tabs into another browser profile. Using Brave or Bing makes this easy.\nRemove bookmarked tabs for these tools and clear browsing history.\nUse extensions to block these sites; Chrome Store has many offering motivational quotes.\n\nDelete Chrome and YouTube from mobile using ADB.\nMove tool emails to spam except weekly updates from Mangools and GSC.\n\n\n\n\n\ndark side of seo\n\n\n\nFinal Thoughts!\n\nAs a programmer, I initially thought a fast website and quality content were key in SEO. I later learned that choosing keywords and acquiring backlinks are crucial.\nA nice Arabic book which will give you true information about SEO دليلك إلي تحسين محركات البحث\nFeel free to DM on Linkedin\nUltimately, backlinks boil down to how many you buy and from whom.\nمنصة صناعة المحتوي العربي\nكم كالوري في الموز\nصيانة افران غاز بالرياض\nشركة تنسيق حدائق بالمدينة المنورة\nشركة تنظيف منازل في العين"

I think there is a better way to write the VLLm version better mine."

    "text": "More search and Ctranslate magic 🎩\nI want to give up , but let’s try a final search how to serve marian model and in an old forum answer i found what is called Ctranslate they say it’s faster than HF transformer for specific architecture by around 4-6x\n#defintion CTranslate2 is a C++ and Python library for efficient inference with Transformer models. The following model types are currently supported:\n\nEncoder-decoder models: Transformer base/big, M2M-100, NLLB, BART, mBART, Pegasus, T5, Whisper\nDecoder-only models: GPT-2, GPT-J, GPT-NeoX, OPT, BLOOM, MPT, Llama, Mistral, Gemma, CodeGen, GPTBigCode, Falcon, Qwen2\nEncoder-only models: BERT, DistilBERT, XLM-RoBERTa\n\nCompatible models should be first converted into an optimized model format. The library includes converters for multiple frameworks:\n\nOpenNMT-py\nOpenNMT-tf\nFairseq\nMarian\nOPUS-MT\nTransformers\n\n\nKey features of Ctranslate\nFast and efficient execution on CPU and GPU\nThe execution is significantly faster and requires less resources than general-purpose deep learning frameworks on supported models and tasks thanks to many advanced optimizations: layer fusion, padding removal, batch reordering, in-place operations, caching mechanism, etc.\n\nQuantization and reduced precision\nThe model serialization and computation support weights with reduced precision: 16-bit floating points (FP16), 16-bit brain floating points (BF16), 16-bit integers (INT16), 8-bit integers (INT8) and AWQ quantization (INT4).\nMultiple CPU architectures support\nThe project supports x86-64 and AArch64/ARM64 processors and integrates multiple backends that are optimized for these platforms: Intel MKL, oneDNN, OpenBLAS, Ruy, and Apple Accelerate.\nAutomatic CPU detection and code dispatch\nOne binary can include multiple backends (e.g. Intel MKL and oneDNN) and instruction set architectures (e.g. AVX, AVX2) that are automatically selected at runtime based on the CPU information.\nParallel and asynchronous execution\nMultiple batches can be processed in parallel and asynchronously using multiple GPUs or CPU cores.\nDynamic memory usage\nThe memory usage changes dynamically depending on the request size while still meeting performance requirements thanks to caching allocators on both CPU and GPU.\nLightweight on disk\nQuantization can make the models 4 times smaller on disk with minimal accuracy loss.\nSimple integration\nThe project has few dependencies and exposes simple APIs in Python and C++ to cover most integration needs.\nConfigurable and interactive decoding\nAdvanced decoding features allow autocompleting a partial sequence and returning alternatives at a specific location in the sequence.\nSupport tensor parallelism for distributed inference\nVery large model can be split into multiple GPUs. Following this documentation to set up the required environment.\n\nSome of these features are difficult to achieve with standard deep learning frameworks and are the motivation for this project.\n\n\nLet’s try it !\ni used the following script to convert the HF version into Ctranslate expected one\nct2-transformers-converter --model NAMAA-Space/masrawy-english-to-egyptian-arabic-translator-v2.9 --output_dir ct2_model_masrawy\nthen i used the model with this version\ntranslator = ctranslate2.Translator(\n    \"ct2_model_masrawy\",\n    device=\"cuda\",\n    compute_type=\"float16\",\n)\nit worked and was very fast much, much faster\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMethod\n\nNumber of Examples\nBatch Size\nGPU setup\nFull time\nDays need\n\n\n\n\nCtranslate + float16\n\n100\n8\n1660TI laptop GPU\n11s\n10.19 days\n\n\nCtranslate + float16\n\n100\n4\n1660TI laptop GPU\n16s\n12.04 days\n\n\nCtranslate\n\n100\n6\n1660TI laptop GPU\n13s\n14.81 days\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwe moved from 32.4 Days into 10 Days!!!"

They encourage applicants to share as much as possible about their interests and abilities.\nSo, here’s my story: I’ve applied to Tarteel 4 times!\n\nThe first time was during my second year of college, seeking an internship. My skills were basic—I had just started learning about deep learning—but the advice they gave me was encouraging and kind.\nAfter graduation, I applied again but was rejected without explanation. I assume it’s because I was a fresh graduate, and they likely needed someone with experience in large-scale projects. That’s fair.\nSeven months later, just before Ramadan 2026, Tarteel announced internship opportunities for the first time. I applied but wasn’t accepted. The competition was tough, and I don’t think I was the strongest candidate at the time—no hard feelings!\nWhat now? I’m determined to prove I have the knowledge and skills to contribute. Here’s what I’m currently working on:\n\nArabic NLP, LLMs, and speech recognition with the Namma community, where I’m contributing to open-source projects and research papers.\nA remote research lab in Russia, which is accelerating my technical growth.\nPlans to join a company to learn about cloud deployment, model optimization, and GPU workloads.\nStudying Quranic sciences and Tajweed to deepen my connection to the field.\nBuilding small projects inspired by Tarteel’s vision to test my abilities and see where they take me."

They offered multiple verification options, and I chose to use my government ID. However, I faced issues: I uploaded my ID about 10 times, and it failed every time, even though the verification platform supported my language. I reached out to their help center, and the fastest response came via email.\nIt took about 12 hours to receive a reply, which felt like a long time. The good news? They instantly verified my ID with no further issues. Later, when I asked another question, their response again took several hours, unlike Hostinger, which typically responds within 1 to 30 minutes (and at most within 2 hours). However, I found Hostinger’s customer service stricter and sometimes less friendly.\nI’ll discuss my reasons for moving later, but for now, let’s focus on the process.\n\n\nI had never transferred a domain before, so I expected it to be challenging. However, Hostinger made the process straightforward without asking why I was transferring.\nHere’s how to do it:\n\nGo to your Hostinger dashboard.\nDisable the Privacy Protection (WHOIS Privacy Protection) button.\nDisable the Transfer Lock button. This may take up to 12 hours to update.\nObtain the Authorization Code (EPP code) from the dashboard and save it, as you’ll need to provide it to Porkbun for the domain transfer.\n\nOn Porkbun’s website: - Enter your domain name in the Domain Name field under the transfer section. - Copy the authorization code from Hostinger and paste it into the Auth Code field. - Click Submit.\nThe transfer(s) will be added to your cart. From there, click Continue to Billing to pay for the transfer. It’s that simple!\nIf your domain is older than 60 days, the transfer typically takes 5 to 7 days. Some domains may transfer in as little as 2 days, but Hostinger will send a verification request via email to confirm the transfer.\nNote: If your domain is less than 60 days old, you’ll need to wait until it passes the 60-day mark. There’s talk of this being reduced to 30 days, but as of this writing (May 2025), the 60-day rule applies, per ICANN regulations, not Hostinger or Porkbun.\n\n\n\nConnecting a domain to Vercel is straightforward. Follow the instructions provided by Vercel, which are similar to those for any registrar. Add the necessary DNS records in Porkbun’s DNS Management section, accessible from the domain management dashboard under your account menu.\nConnecting to Railway was trickier. I needed an intermediary, and I chose Cloudflare to manage my Porkbun domain’s DNS. Here’s how it worked:\n\nConfigure Cloudflare to manage your Porkbun domain.\nAdd the necessary Railway DNS records to Cloudflare.\nWait approximately 1 to 2 days for the DNS changes to propagate.\n\nOnce the DNS updates are complete, your domain should work seamlessly with Railway."

    "text": "What is PALID index?\nPLAID index is for indexing very large datasets with Later interaction models like (Colbertv2 & ColPali) IT Solves the storage footprint and allow you to scale to infinity\nThey swapped the faiss from facebook what is nice thing because i have multiple bad time to install it especially the GPU version.\nand used fastkeamns from the amazing @bclaive which i really like his work on embeddings\nIt’s replacement for Voyager-based HNSW index which was very bad for scaling Late-Interaction retrieval models"

    "text": "Prime Intellect VS Gpuvec\nI was creating a website to find and compare the cloud compute instances from all cloud providers in easy and interactive way.\nI started to work on it the last month, but stoped for other work.\nsuddenly i found this website which is called Prime intellect.\nAnd i just want to say,woooooow. it’s a piece of art. The design and information on it and how fast, accurate is very embrassing for my poor gpuvec.com\nshould i continue improve my website?\nActually yes, we share similar goals but there is multiple chances to compete or even collaborite!! who knows!\nThey are more than just listing and compare prices, then enable you to use these GPUs from their website.\nAlso they create decentralized models and have a mutliple expirened engineers."

    "text": "Q: What is PyLate and what does it do? A: PyLate is a Python library for vector retrieval and search, specifically designed for ColBERT models. It provides tools for indexing documents, encoding queries, and performing similarity search.\n\n\n\nQ: How does ColBERT work? A: ColBERT (Contextualized Late Interaction over BERT) creates dense vector representations for documents and queries, then uses late interaction (token-level matching) for retrieval instead of single vector similarity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQ: What does triplet format look like? A: Each row contains: - query: The search query - positive: One relevant document\n- negative1, negative2, …: Multiple irrelevant documents\nPros: Good for training with hard negatives Cons: No separate corpus, harder to evaluate\n\n\n\nQ: What does structured format contain? A: Three separate components: - corpus: All documents with IDs - queries: All queries with IDs - qrels: Relevance judgments (query-doc pairs)\nPros: Standard IR evaluation format, works with PyLate directly Cons: More complex structure\n\n\n\nQ: How does passage ranking format work? A: Each row has: - query_id, query: Query information - positive_passages: List of relevant documents - negative_passages: List of irrelevant documents\nPros: Multiple positives/negatives per query, rich annotations Cons: Requires extraction to create corpus\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQ: How do you handle large datasets efficiently? A: Stream processing with direct file writing:\nwith open('corpus.jsonl', 'w') as f:\n    for el in dataset['corpus']:\n        if el['corpus-id'] and el['text']:\n            json.dump({\"_id\": el['corpus-id'], \"text\": el['text']}, f)\n            f.write('\\n')\nPros: Low memory usage, handles any dataset size Cons: Requires file I/O, slightly slower\n\n\n\nQ: What files does BEIR datasets is ? A: - corpus.jsonl: {\"_id\": \"doc1\", \"text\": \"document text\"} - queries.jsonl: {\"_id\": \"q1\", \"text\": \"query text\"} - qrels/split.tsv: query_id\\tdoc_id\\tscore\nCritical: File names and folder structure must match exactly\n\n\n\nQ: How do you convert without files? A: Transform to PyLate’s expected return format:\ndocuments = [{\"id\": doc_id, \"text\": text} for doc_id, text in corpus.items()]\nqueries = list(queries.values())\n# qrels stays as dictionary\nPros: Faster, no file operations Cons: Must match exact format, harder to debug\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQ: When do you use ranx for evaluation? A: When you have non-standard formats or want custom metrics:\nqrels = Qrels(qrels_dict)\nrun = Run(run_dict)\nmetrics = evaluate(qrels, run, [\"ndcg@5\", \"map@5\"])\nPros: Flexible, works with any format Cons: Manual setup required\n\n\n\nQ: When do you use PyLate’s evaluation? A: When data is in standard BEIR format with proper file structure\nPros: Standardized, less code Cons: Strict format requirements\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQ: What is PLAID indexing? A: PyLate’s efficient indexing method for ColBERT embeddings, supporting fast similarity search\nKey Parameters: - index_folder: Where to store index - index_name: Identifier for the index\n- override=True: Overwrites existing index\n\n\n\nQ: How do you prepare documents for indexing? A: 1. Extract unique documents from all sources 2. Create document IDs and embeddings 3. Add to index with add_documents()\nImportant: Use is_query=False for documents, is_query=True for queries\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQ: What are common file format mistakes? A: - Wrong file extensions (.csv instead of .tsv) - Incorrect folder structure (missing qrels folder) - Wrong field names (id vs _id)\n\n\n\nQ: How do you handle variable-length lists? A: Use nested loops for negative passages:\nfor row in dataset:\n    for neg_doc in row['negative_passages']:\n        # process each negative document\n\n\n\nQ: How do you avoid memory issues? A: - Process datasets in chunks - Use generators instead of lists - Write to files incrementally - Use dictionaries to avoid duplicates\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQ: How do you optimize encoding speed? A: Use appropriate batch sizes: - Larger batches: Faster but more memory - Smaller batches: Slower but memory-safe - Typical: batch_size=32 or batch_size=64\n\n\n\nQ: How do you manage multiple indexes? A: Use descriptive names and separate folders: - index_folder=\"arabic_index\" - index_name=\"gte-multilingual-base\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQ: What metrics should you track? A: - NDCG@k: Normalized discounted cumulative gain - MAP@k: Mean average precision\n- Recall@k: Proportion of relevant docs retrieved - Precision@k: Proportion of retrieved docs that are relevant\n\n\n\nQ: What makes good retrieval performance? A: - NDCG@5 &gt; 0.7: Excellent - NDCG@5 &gt; 0.5: Good\n- NDCG@5 &gt; 0.3: Acceptable - NDCG@5 &lt; 0.3: Needs improvement\nThis comprehensive guide covers all the key concepts, trade-offs, and practical considerations for working with PyLate and ColBERT evaluation pipelines."

    "text": "Static Embedding with Qdrant and Model2vec\nStatic embedding from minishLab reduce the model size with 15x reduction and up to 500x speed increase while the maintain more than 85% of the performance levels. it’s like our zaraah model for arabic.\nStatic embedding are dense embedding so you can also use with qdrant collections. The retrieval is not going to be any faster becuase static embeddings. but the speedup is in creating the vectors from your data and encoding the queries.\nIf you want to make the retrieval faster use the following: 1. Matryoshka Embeddings 2. Quantization methods like (Scalar and Binary Quantization) ### When to use Static Embeddings ?\n\nMobile applications - although many smartphones have powerful CPUs or even GPUs, the battery life is still a concern, and the static embeddings might be a good compromise between the quality and the power consumption. Moreover, the static embeddings can be used in the applications that require offline mode.\nWeb browser extensions - running a transformer-based model in a web browser is usually not quite an option, but static embeddings might be a good choice, as they have fewer parameters and are faster to encode.\nEmbedded systems - the static embeddings might be a good choice for the devices with limited computational power, such as IoT devices or microcontrollers.\n\n\nReferences:\nThere is more text in here from Qdrant not me..you can continue reading here\n\nHotel Search\nQdrant Blog\nStatic Embedding"
