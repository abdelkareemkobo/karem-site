We use these classes of functions to express how fast the running time or memory used by an algorithm grows as the input becomes larger.\n• Some of the most common classes of functions, the ones you will see more often are\n– O(1)–constant—Whenever a resource grows independently of n (for example, a basic instruction).\n\n– O(log(n))–logarithmic—Slow growth, like binary search.\n\n– O(n)–linear—A function that grows at the same rate as the input, like the number of comparisons you need in a linear search.\n\n– O(n*log(n))–linearithmic—We’ll see this order of growth for priority queues.\n\n– O(n2)–quadratic—Functions in this class grow too fast for resources to be manageable beyond about a million elements. An example is the number of pairs in an array.\n\n– O(2n)–exponential—Functions with exponential growth have huge values for n &gt; 30 already.

    "text": "Dyanmic Arrays\n• Arrays are great containers when we need to access elements based on their position. They provide constant-time access to any element, and we can read or write any element without sequentially accessing the elements before it.\n• However, arrays are inherently static. That is, because of the way they are implemented in memory, their size cannot be changed once they are created.\n• Having a fixed-size container means that we can’t be flexible if we find that we need to store more elements. Furthermore, allocating a large array from the start to support the largest possible number of elements is often a waste of memory.\n• Dynamic arrays are a way to get the best of arrays and add some flexibility. They are not a different type of data structure. They use fixed-size arrays but add a strategy to grow and shrink them as needed, reallocating the underlying static array each time it needs to be resized.\n• The best strategy for dynamic arrays is to double the size of the underlying static array when we try to insert a new element into a full array and halve the size of the array when, after removing an element, three-quarters of the elements are empty\n• This flexibility comes at a cost: insert and delete can’t be constant time as they are for static unsorted arrays. But for the insert method (and, under some assumptions, for the delete method as well), we can guarantee that n operations take an O(n) amortized running time and additional memor\n\nclass DyanmicArray:\n    def __init__(self, initial_capacity: int = 1, typecode: str = \"l\") -&gt; None:\n        self._array = Array(initial_capacity, typecode)\n        self._capacity = initial_capacity\n        self._size = 0\n        self._typecode = typecode\n\n    def __len__(self) -&gt; int:\n        return self._size\n\n    def __getitem__(self, index) -&gt; Union[int, float]:\n        if index &gt;= self.size:\n            raise IndexError(f\"Index out of bound: {index}\")\n        return self._array[index]\n\n    def __repr__(self) -&gt; str:\n        return repr(self._array._array[: self._size])\n\n    def __iter__(self):\n        for i in range(self._size):\n            yield self._array[i]\n\n    def _is_full(self):\n        return self._size &gt;= self._capacity\n\n    def _double_size(self):\n        assert self._capacity == self._size\n        old_array = self._array\n        self._array = Array(self._capacity * 2, self._typecode)\n        self._capacity *= 2\n        for i in range(self._size):\n            self._array[i] = old_array[i]\n        assert self._array._size == self._capacity\n\n    def _halve_size(self):\n        assert (\n            self._capacity &gt; 1 and self._size &lt;= self._capacity / 4\n        )  # Invariant: this is called only when capacity &gt; 1 and size &lt;= capacity/4\n        old_array = self._array\n        self._array == Array(self._capacity // 2, self._typecode)\n        self._capacity //= 2\n        for i in range(self._size):\n            self._array[i] = old_array[i]\n        assert self._array._size == self._capacity\n\n    def is_empty(self):\n        return len(self) == 0\n\n    def insert(self, value: Union[int, float]) -&gt; None:\n        if self._is_full():\n            self._double_size()\n        self._array[self._size] = value\n\n    def find(self, target: Union[int, float]) -&gt; Union[int, None]:\n        for i in range(self._size):\n            if self._array[i] == target:\n                return i\n        return None\n\n    def delete(self, target: Union[int, float]) -&gt; None:\n        index = self.find(target)\n        if index is None:\n            raise ValueError(\n                f\"Unable to delete element {target} the entry is not in the array\"\n            )\n        for i in range(index, self._size - 1):\n            self._array[i] = self._array[i + 1]\n        self._size -= 1\n        if self._capacity &gt; 1 and self._size &lt;= self._capacity / 4:\n            self._halve_size()"

This is slow and inconvenient—I don’t like having to open my phone often. Most of the time, my meals are repetitive, and recording them on the Huawei Health app is boring, so I usually just do a quick add.\nIn the future, I hope they let us add a list of meals to the app so we can select them directly from the watch."

I spoke to her again shortly after, and she asked me for specific information about the watch to check if it was under warranty or not. She followed up with me two days later, then again a day after that, and again two days later until I managed to get the invoice from Amazon. She tried to solve the issue by recommending an exchange and even told me which day to go when there would be discounts on the products.\nHonestly, it was the best customer service experience I’ve ever had. She was able to go beyond being just a robot to become someone who understands, values, and helps—a human experience that brings joy.\nAt the very least, I had to document and acknowledge that she is someone exceptional. I requested to give her a rating, and I did. I’m really happy about that.\nBut I haven’t fixed the watch yet because there are no spare parts available in Egypt."

If you type your passwords and credit card info into the digital keyboard of your phone, you don’t expect those passwords to end up on the server of the company that developed that keyboard, do you?

In fact, those regulations sometimes even prevent single organizations from combining their own users’ data for machine learning training because those users live in different parts of the world, and their data is governed by different data protection regulations\nLess Compute Training large ml models on big data stores is computationally expensive and traditional centralized training efficiency is limited by single-machine performance.\nFast Training Federated learning once the data is received the model start training immediately, this gives the user more robust and intelligent system that solves it’s needs"

I believe these platforms are not the best places for technical blogs, and their disadvantages outweigh the advantages.\nI value the freedom of speech. Some topics or thoughts may be censored on social media, but I want to express my opinions without restrictions from others whose opinions I may not respect.\nI want to discuss topics while I’m learning them because they’re still fresh in my mind. This will help anyone in a similar position as me in the future.\nWhen studying a topic and knowing that I can write about it on my blog, I find my mind more focused on details that would fit well in the blog. This makes the learning process more enjoyable, focused, and valuable.\nI want my posts and knowledge to be more organized!\n\nWho will search for a post written six years ago on Facebook or see your first tweet?\nThis problem is related to the feed of these social platforms."

    "text": "Unlocking SEO Potential with NLP: A Journey of Website Optimization\nIn the vast digital landscape, the visibility of a website amidst the sea of search results can make or break its success. Search Engine Optimization (SEO) stands as the beacon guiding businesses towards the shores of higher visibility and traffic. As the digital realm evolves, so do the strategies employed to enhance SEO. One such frontier that holds immense promise is the integration of Natural Language Processing (NLP) into SEO practices.\n\nUnderstanding the Landscape\nSEO isn’t just about optimizing keywords anymore; it’s about understanding user intent, predicting trends, and delivering value-rich content. Harnessing the power of NLP, we embark on a journey to revolutionize SEO practices for our websites. Here’s how we’re leveraging NLP to bolster our SEO efforts:\n\n\n1. Daily Downloads and Keyword Integration\nWe kickstart our journey by integrating Google Search Console into our workflow. By fetching daily downloads of our top queries, we gain invaluable insights into user behavior and preferences. These queries are seamlessly integrated into a specific folder, forming the backbone of our content optimization strategy.\n\n\n2. Content Analysis and Optimization\nNLP comes into play as we meticulously analyze our content to ensure alignment with the top queries identified. By leveraging NLP techniques, we ascertain the presence of these keywords within our content, ensuring relevance and resonance with our audience’s search intent.\n\n\n3. Predictive Analytics and Trend Spotting\nPowered by NLP, we delve into the realm of predictive analytics to forecast future trends. By analyzing historical data and current patterns, we identify emerging trends and capitalize on them proactively. This enables us to stay ahead of the curve and position our content strategically to meet evolving user demands.\n\n\n4. Semantic and Exact Match Integration\nNLP empowers us to delve deeper into the semantics of language, enabling us to differentiate between exact matches and similar meanings. Through advanced NLP algorithms, we ensure that our content not only features exact keyword matches but also resonates with synonymous terms, enhancing its visibility across diverse search queries.\n\n\nLeveling Up the Game\nAs we progress on our journey of NLP-driven SEO optimization, we outline a roadmap for leveling up our capabilities:\n\nLevel 1:\n\nData Management: Implementing robust data storage solutions tailored to multiple websites.\nVisualization: Crafting compelling visualizations using tools like Bokeh and Plotly.\nMachine Learning Models: Developing forecasting models to predict future trends.\nSemantic Search: Leveraging vector databases for semantic and exact search capabilities.\n\n\n\nLevel 2:\n\nOptimization: Streamlining our codebase through asynchronous processing and caching mechanisms.\n\n\n\nLevel 3:\n\nProduct Development: Exploring avenues to transform our NLP-driven SEO framework into software products like WordPress plugins or desktop applications.\n\n\n\nLevel 4:\n\nInnovation: Drawing inspiration from industry leaders to create bespoke solutions, such as an Arabic version of our SEO platform akin to UberSuggest and Guni Rank.\n\n\n\n\nConclusion\nI mainly using NLP with python to improve my landing pages for home services like the following services: Here are the markdown links with target titles for the provided text:\n\nشركة عزل فوم بالمدينة المنورة\nشركة عزل فوم بمكة\nشركة عزل فوم بالطائف\nشركة عزل اسطح بالاحساء\nشركة عزل اسطح بالدمام\nمنصة صناعة المحتوي العربي\nحجز موعد فحص المركبات بالدمام\n\nIn the ever-evolving landscape of SEO, the integration of NLP marks a paradigm shift towards more sophisticated and nuanced optimization strategies. By harnessing the power of NLP, we not only decipher the language of search but also anticipate and cater to the evolving needs of our audience. As we continue to refine our approach and explore new frontiers, the synergy between NLP and SEO promises to redefine the digital landscape, empowering businesses to thrive in an era of unparalleled connectivity and discovery. you can read more articles here"

    "text": "Definition: SEO is optimizing your website pages to appear in the top results of search engines like Google and Bing.\n\nWhy is this important? It makes you visible to more people who are interested in what you provide—products, services, news, etc.\nEnough of the basics. I assume you already know what SEO is about. Now, let’s explore a darker side of being involved in SEO.\n\nHow to Track Your Changes\n\nSince SEO revolves around ranking, how do you track your position?\nThere are multiple tools I enjoy using, such as:\n\nI love to manually search keywords and track their ranks myself! :)\n\nI do this often when I need a break at the gym or during study breaks.\n\nSEMrush\n\nI use it to check domain authority, organic keywords, and traffic increase.\nSeeing green in increased Ref. Domains and Authority Score brings joy.\nI don’t use it for anything else! :)\n\nRanking Math\n\nSay hi to the overrated WordPress SEO plugin “Ranking Math SEO”\nIt claims to simplify content optimization with built-in suggestions based on widely-accepted practices.\nI use Rankmath Pro on a website I manage, showing impressions, total keywords, average position, and clicks. GSC offers all this for free!\nThis post isn’t about Rankmath; that’s for another time. In short:\n\nAI tools\nAMP\nAnalysis from Google Analytics\nInstant indexing\nBacklinks count\nLocal SEO\nNews sitemap\nPodcasts\nSchema\nSEO analysis\nSitemap\nVideo Sitemap\nWooCommerce\nGoogle Web Stories\n\nNone of these significantly impact SEO and ranking; there are other effective methods.\nWhat matters most to me with Rankmath is:\n\nTop 5 performing posts\nOther keywords\n\nI mainly use Rankmath for its focus keyword section in each article.\n\nMangools\n\nMy preferred tool! Its UI/UX is excellent, and it’s fast and efficient unlike other tools.\nWith the free account, I get:\n\n5 keyword researches daily\n8 SERP checks\n1,000 backlink analyses\nDomain profile checks for 2 domains daily\n\nFor Arabic, its keyword ideas aren’t as good.\n\nGoogle Search Console\n\nA free tool by Google offering most SEO tools’ functionalities for free and accurately.\nYou get:\n\nPerformance of your website for any keyword at any time in any region!\nPage indexing status\nBacklink analysis\nPage experience and more\n\nYou might notice a recurring theme:\n\nCharts\nChanging numbers everywhere, numbers galore!\n\n\nNeil Patel\n\nRank tracking\nSEO opportunities\nSite audit\nKeyword research\nTraffic estimation\nBacklinks\n\nKeyword Tool\n\nFor Arabic, it provides the most related suggested keywords, though many aren’t quite relevant.\n\nGuinRank\n\nNew and more tailored for Arabic, gaining power.\nI use its content and keyword tools for Arabic, providing helpful recommendations and statistics for choosing useful keywords.\n\nMoz\n\nThey even blocked my IP -__-\n\n\n\nStarting to Lose!\n\nWhat’s going wrong? I hate losing after investing time, money, and mental health into something. If you’re like me, SEO can be crushing.\n“SEO is like gambling” ~ Kareem\n\n\n\n\n\nHow to recover form SEO addiction\n\n\n\nLosing Backlinks\n\nSpam backlinks (like Khamsat, Fiverr, and Upwork)—most are harmful.\nPBN Network\n\nThis service claims safe PBNs for backlinks from Web 2.0 blogs, profiles, social bookmarking, social likes/shares, etc. I tried it, and none appeared in GSC after 3 months; worse, my site’s rank dropped.\n\nManually Added Backlinks\n\nThis package offers 70 PR10 backlinks from foreign websites, 60 Arabic guest posts, and 10 EDU backlinks, etc.\nIt worked to some extent, but the impact was minimal. Four backlinks from specific places helped more than these services.\n\nOther services are mostly spam backlinks; some guest posts might help, but aim for real backlinks spaced out from related sites.\n\nLosing Ranking\n\nThis month, a home services website I manage improved from 65th to 9th in rankings, then disappeared, and later ranked 40th, etc.\nThis cycle repeats—a page gains rank, then drops.\nIt’s stressful; don’t check daily. Weekly (or every 2-3 weeks) is less stressful and gives fairer results, focusing on what’s important.\n\nWhat’s Going Wrong?\n\nWatching page changes from these tools is like social media’s new “like” button!\nMy mind loves the green and red numbers.\nUltimately, most analyses aren’t critical. Whether 23rd or 80th, if not in the top 5, what’s the use? Daily checks yield nothing; reaching top 5 goes unnoticed until notifications and calls confirm it.\nIf SEO is your sole income source, it’s a tough job—even though it can make you a millionaire sometimes.\n\nHow to Recover\n\nHere’s what helped me recover from this addiction:\nCreate barriers for easy access:\n\nSeparate Google accounts/tabs into another browser profile. Using Brave or Bing makes this easy.\nRemove bookmarked tabs for these tools and clear browsing history.\nUse extensions to block these sites; Chrome Store has many offering motivational quotes.\n\nDelete Chrome and YouTube from mobile using ADB.\nMove tool emails to spam except weekly updates from Mangools and GSC.\n\n\n\n\n\ndark side of seo\n\n\n\nFinal Thoughts!\n\nAs a programmer, I initially thought a fast website and quality content were key in SEO. I later learned that choosing keywords and acquiring backlinks are crucial.\nA nice Arabic book which will give you true information about SEO دليلك إلي تحسين محركات البحث\nFeel free to DM on Linkedin\nUltimately, backlinks boil down to how many you buy and from whom.\nمنصة صناعة المحتوي العربي\nشركة تنظيف منازل بالكويت\nشركة عزل اسطح بالاحساء\nشركة عزل اسطح بالقطيف\nشركة عزل اسطح بالجبيل"

For each sentence in the first set, the best match in the second set needs to be found.\n\nThe matches are commonly translations.\nThe Provided model i used to embed each sentence and the closest pairs are found via cosine similarity\nF1 serves as the main metric for bitext mining.Accuracy, precision and recall are also computed. #definition Classification\nA train and test set are embedded with the provided model.\nThe train set embeddings are used to train a logistic regression classifier with 100 maximum iterations, which is scored on the test set.\nThe main metric is accuracy with average precision and f1 additionally provided. #definition Clustering Given a set of sentences or paragraphs, the goal is to group them into meaningful clusters.\nA mini-batch k-means model with batch size 32 and k equal to the number of different labels is trained on the embedded texts.\nThe model scored using V-measure - V-measure does not depend on the cluster label,thus the permutation of labels does not affect the score. #definition Classification A pair of text inputs is provided and a label needs to be assigned. Labels are typically binary variables denoting duplicate or paraphrase pairs.\nThe two texts are embedded and their distance is computed with various metrics (cosine similarity, dot product, euclidean distance, manhattan distance).\nUsing the best binary thresh- old accuracy, average precision, f1, precision and recall are computed.\nThe average precision score based on cosine similarity is the main metric. #definition Reranking : Inputs are a query and a list of relevant and irrelevant reference texts. The aim is to rank the results according to their relevance to the query.\nThe model is used to embed the references which are then compared to the query using cosine similarity.\nThe resulting ranking is scored for each query and averaged across all queries.\nMetrics are mean MRR@k and MAP with the latter being the main metric. #definition Retrieval Each dataset consists of a corpus, queries and a mapping for each query to relevant documents from the corpus.\nThe aim is to find these relevant documents.\nThe provided model is used to embed all queries and all corpus documents and similarity scores are computed using cosine similarity. After ranking the corpus documents for each query based on the scores, nDCG@k, MRR@k, MAP@k, precision@k and recall@k are computed for several values of k. nDCG@10 serves as the main metric.\nMTEB reuses datasets and evaluation from BEIR (Thakur et al., 2021). #definition Semantic Textual Similarity (STS) Given a sentence pair the aim is to determine their similarity. Labels are continuous scores with higher numbers indicating more similar sentences.\nThe provided model is used to embed the sentences and their similarity is computed using various distance metrics.\nDistances are benchmarked with ground truth similarities using Pearson and Spearman correlations.\nSpearman correlation based on cosine similarity serves as the main metric (Reimers et al.,2016). #definition Summarization A set of human-written and machine-generated summaries are provided. The aim is to score the machine summaries. The provided model is first used to embed all summaries. For each machine summary embedding, distances to all human summary embeddings are computed. The closest score (e.g. highest cosine similarity) is kept and used as the model’s score of a single machine-generated summary. Pearson and Spearman correlations with ground truth human assessments of the machine-generated summaries are computed. Like for STS, Spearman correlation based on cosine similarity serves as the main metric\n\n\n#sidenote Non-Transformers : LASER (Heffernan et al.,2022) is the only context aware non-transformer model we benchmark, relying on an LSTM (Hochreiter and Schmidhuber, 1997) instead. Similar to LaBSE, the model trains on parallel data and focuses on bitext mining applications. ![[Pasted image 20231028124555.png]]"

    "text": "Analysis\n\nwe observe that there is considerable variability between tasks. No model claims the state-of-the-art in all seven English tasks.\nThere is even more variability in the results per dataset present in the appendix.\nFurther, there remains a large gap between self-supervised and supervised methods.\nSelf-supervised large language models have been able to close this gap in many natural language generation tasks (Chowd- hery et al., 2022).\nHowever, they appear to still require supervised fine-tuning for competitive em- bedding performance.\nWe find that performance strongly coorelates with model size, A majority of MTEB tasks are domainted by multi-billion parameter models.However, these come at a significant cost\nFor classification\n\nST5 models dominate the classification task across most datasets\nST5-XXL has the highest average performance, 3% ahead of the best non-ST5 model, OpenAI Ada Similarity\n\nClustering\n\nDespite being almost 50x smaller, the MPNet embedding model is on par with the ST5- XXL state-of-the-art on Clustering. This may be due to the large variety of datasets MPNet (and MiniLM) has been fine-tuned on.\nClustering requires coherent distances between a large number of embeddings.\nModels like SimCSE-sup or SGPTnli, which are only fine-tuned on a single dataset,NLI, may produce incoherent embeddings when encountering topics unseen during fine-tuning.\nRelatedly, we find that the query embeddings of SGPT-msmarco and the Ada Search endpoint are competitive with SGPT-nli and the Ada Similarity endpoint,respectively.\nWe refer to the public leaderboard5 for Ada Search results. This could be due to the MSMARCO dataset being significantly larger than NLI.\nThus, while the OpenAI docs recommend using the similarity embeddings for clustering use cases6 , the retrieval query embeddings may be the better choice in some cases.\n\nPair Classification\n\nGTR-XL and GTR-XXL have the strongest performance. Pair classification is closest to STS in its framing, yet models rank significantly differently on the two tasks. This highlights the importance of benchmarking on a diverse set of tasks to avoid blindly reusing a model for a different task.\n\nReranking\n\nMPNet and MiniLM models perform strongly on reranking tasks.\nOn SciDocsRR (Co-han et al., 2020a) they perform far better than big- ger models, which is likely due to parts of SciDocsRR being included in their training data.\nOur scale of experiments and that of model pre-training make controlling for data contamination challenging.\nThus, we ignore overlap of MTEB datasets with model training datasets in MTEB scores.\nAs long as enough datasets are averaged, we believe these effects to be insignificant.\n\nRetrieval\n\nSGPT-5.8B-msmarco is the best em- bedding model on the BEIR subset in MTEB as well as on the full BEIR benchmark (Thakur et al., 2021; Muennighoff, 2022).\nThe even larger 7.1B SGPT model making use of BLOOM (Scao et al., 2022) performs significantly weaker, which is likely due to the multilinguality of BLOOM.\nModels geared towards STS (SimCSE, ST5, SGPT- nli) perform badly on retrieval tasks.\nRetrieval tasks are unique in that there are two distinct types of texts: Queries and documents (“asymmetric”), while other tasks only have a single type of text (“symmetric”).\nOn the QuoraRetrieval dataset, which has been shown to be largely symmetric (Muennighoff, 2022), the playing field is more even with SGPT-5.8B-nli outperforming SGPT- 5.8B-msmarco,\n\nSTS & Summarization\n\nRetrieval models (GTR, SGPT-msmarco) perform badly on STS, while ST5-XXL has the highest performance.\nThis highlights the bifurcation of the field into separate embedding models for retrieval (asymmetric) and similarity (symmetric) use cases (Muennighoff, 2022)."

After 1 week I get a lot of errors on it with the external monitor and the WiFi stops working or is not configured. I tried every Hindi video about this problem and gave it to specialists to try it, but in vain, the problem happened again and again.\nThe solution: It was my first year at a computer science college, so the geeky thing was to use Linux. After some search, I installed Ubuntu and then tried a lot of distros like Void Linux, but the one that I picked and still use is the amazing PopOS! which is based on Ubuntu but better than it!\nThe WiFi problem doesn’t appear again! And for Nvidia graphics, it’s solved in PopOS! which has a command to install some drivers. And everything works smoothly\n\n\nThe Cost of It!\nI bought it for the cost of 20,000 EGP, which at the time I bought it was $X, but now 20,000 EGP is worth $XX due to problems in my country.\nIts cost at that time is really high for my budget and family, but I insisted on buying it because I knew it would stay with me for years, so I wanted a good one.\n\n\nHow I Decided to Buy It!\nThe phrase “Machine learning needs an Nvidia GPU” was dancing in my mind, so my main focus was on a nice GPU card in a laptop with a low budget. After some search, I found that the best choices are MSI or Lenovo, but the Lenovo version cost about 4000 EGP more than the MSI.\n\nI tested the keyboard of the Lenovo, and every time I felt like I wanted to cut my fingers off\n\nIt wasn’t available online, so I had to travel 3 hours to the store that sells it. It was a nice experience to buy something I wanted instead of a random gift from my father."

    "text": "Kobo for ML\n Machine learning is a wide area, and you can use the GPU for 3 things:\n\nTrain a model from scratch\nFine-tune a model\nEvaluate a model (inference)\n\n\nTrain a model from scratch was an ideal task for such a GPU, but I was doing it for multiple computer vision classification tasks, learning new architectures, trying to build…etc. For ML you don’t always need a GPU but for deep learning, which is a subset of ML that uses more connected layers (which means more computing power and memory needs), you do.\nFine-tune a model is the case I used the most - I download a trained model and try to make it work better on my data. What you need here is enough GPU RAM - in my case it’s a 6GB card. This worked fine with computer vision algorithms and classic NLP models with less than 1 billion parameters. There’s no chance to try the LLAMAS models on such a card!\nEvaluate a model means to just load the model and not fine-tune it.\n\nI was fine with all the ML tasks I tried to do, unless I opened the door to large language models like the GPT family (ChatGPT for example). These models require a lot of memory and need a good graphics card like an RTX 30 or 40 series to test, and there’s no chance to train these models on any RTX card!\n\nWhy Not Just Use the Cloud!\nThere are two main solutions:\n\nKaggle\n\nKaggle has two GPU options, and I used it a lot, especially if the data was already hosted on Kaggle and was more than 10GB. Other than that, I downloaded a sample of the data and did my work on my own environment with CLI commands and VS Code configurations. This helped me a lot compared to just using the Kaggle editor, and it’s faster too! Sometimes the Kaggle kernel panics or just stops responding entirely!\n\nColab\n\nColab restarts after 4 hours and your work can get lost, and lots of annoying things like that happen a lot.\nYou have to pay for the GPU version. You get a number of hours to try it out, and it’s faster than my GTX 1660 by a good margin.\n\n\nBut I didn’t love these cloud solutions, and I found having my own local setup to be faster and more comfortable."

I then tested the noise-cancelling feature and was amazed when I couldn’t hear my younger brother calling me.\nThe street noises were effectively blocked out, with only a faint hum reaching my ears, which was quite tolerable. Initially, the earbud tips were a bit uncomfortable, but after switching to a smaller size, the discomfort was resolved. Everything seemed perfect, except for a slight pressure in my ears when using the noise-cancelling feature, particularly noticeable the following morning. Despite this, my ears seem to crave the earbuds and my skin seems to miss them when they’re not in use. This can be a bit of a downside, but it’s not always the case."

It wasn’t overly bothersome, but it didn’t provide complete isolation.\n\nIn summary, the noise-cancelling feature works well, but it doesn’t provide absolute silence. I can still hear some ambient sounds. One noticeable issue is that when I make calls using the earbuds, I can hear the other person clearly, but they often complain about the clarity of my voice. They say it sounds distant and unclear, sometimes even asking to call back later. This issue is particularly prevalent when I’m on the bus."

Useful for hearing announcements at the gym or people talking to you. However, my own voice sounds muted in this mode, so I have to remove the earbuds temporarily to hold conversations.\n\nSound Quality Presets:\n\nDefault: No sound enhancements applied.\nTreble Boost: Boosts treble frequencies. I haven’t used this.\nBass Boost: Emphasizes bass when listening to music like hip-hop.\nVoices: Optimizes sound for speech clarity. I use this for podcasts.\n\nConnection Priority Modes:\n\nBalance Mode: Balances audio quality and connection stability.\nSound Quality Priority: Prioritizes sound quality over connectivity. Uses more power which may cause occasional lag.\n\nI have not noticed any discernible difference between these two modes, so I just use the Balance mode."

    "text": "I am a fresh graduate from AI college, i spent the last 4 years learning about both Computer science and AI.\nI was learning some math, machine learning , Deep learning and a lot of programming with python and C++, spent some a lot of time learning web also for freelance jobs.\na lot of time i had multiple interviews while i was a student in the summer and all the time the questions was about linkedlist, and some medium leetcode question and a few of them was about frameworks like pytorch or pandas.\nI faced a strange fact when i started to work on life projects or some advanced books…etc they require a strong problem solving skills that i don’t have!!\nI am revisiting these topics and will try to get out from the juypter notebook and kaggle world in software engineer with python and focus more on open source projects.\nI want to reazlie the time/memeory order of the data structures i am using in my projects\nI have read the algorithm book v3 and spent 6 months on codeforces with c++ i remember these days where i could spent around 10 hours per day solving problems with myself before the AI assistants like GPT..etc i am missing the good feeling after every problem i manage to solve and i was able to write around 90 lines of code without research or AI help..etc.\nI will start learning again about this topics and make them a daily habit to solve a problem per day: - [grokking_ds] - it’s a new book about data structure in python and explained with the grokking style\n[DS with python] - it’s a mostafa saad ibrhaim udemy course with python version with a lot of problems to solve\n[neetcode] - a roadmap to focus on some problems selected from neetcode\n[coding challenges] - A SE problems to help you focus more on how to build projects not just problem solving which will help me to start doing some open source\n\n\n\n- multiple time when i was trying to building some solutions related to NLP or graph neural network i know that this problem must solved with Linkedlist and this needs a type of tree then i struggle to continue....\n- Learning about some NLP Algorithms or the new searching and matching techniques most of the time they are math equations with some optimizations you can't fully understand unless your skills in problem solving\n- research in DL needs a huge skills in problem solving and how to understand the following architectures then update or utilize them to your needs more in this in the future but i think the better you are in SE the better you are in ML.\n\n\n\n\nArrays"
