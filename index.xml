<section id="buying-the-huawei-gt4" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="buying-the-huawei-gt4">Buying the Huawei GT4</h2>
<ul>
<li>I bought it from Amazon for 13,000 EGP. I opened it immediately, and it looked so nice; I was very happy with its design and feel.</li>
<li>I charged it with the wireless stand.</li>
<li>I wore it after an hour and took some time to download the Huawei Health app on my Realme6 mobile.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="feeling-pain" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="feeling-pain">Feeling pain</h2>
<ul>
<li>I wore it, and after three days, my hand started to hurt, causing some discomfort because I was sleeping with it on without removing it.</li>
<li>I wore it on my right hand for four days, then switched it to my left hand, and my body felt more comfortable with it.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="the-design-of-the-huawei-watch-gt4" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-design-of-the-huawei-watch-gt4">The Design of the Huawei watch gt4</h2>
<ul>
<li>The design is attractive, and many people who saw me wearing it didn’t notice that it was a smartwatch—they thought it was a classic watch.</li>
<li>Others said that it looks better than the repetitive and dull design of the Apple Watch.</li>
<li>It looks very premium.</li>
<li>The brightness in sunlight is impressive.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="sleeping-with-huawei-watch-gt4" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="sleeping-with-huawei-watch-gt4">Sleeping with Huawei watch gt4</h2>
<ul>
<li>The accuracy of the sleep detector is almost perfect. Sometimes, when you leave the watch near you for 6 hours, it detects that you are sleeping, but this has only happened maybe three times this year.</li>
<li>The accuracy of detecting sleep cycles and the time for each is spot on, and the graph analysis and statistics on this watch are easy to understand, creative, and full of information.</li>
<li>Why can’t I set an alarm based on the sleep cycle, like in the <a href="https://www.sleepcycle.com/">Sleep Cycle app</a>? This feature would be a game-changer!</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="calories-calculations-with-huawei-health" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="calories-calculations-with-huawei-health">Calories calculations with huawei health</h2>
<ul>
<li>You enter your information, like weight and height, and based on your vitals and activity, it detects the calories you burn every second. I like this estimation feature.</li>
<li>You can set a goal, for example, to go from 92 kg to 85 kg, but the problem is you need to calculate the calories and record it using the phone, not the watch. This is slow and inconvenient—I don’t like having to open my phone often. Most of the time, my meals are repetitive, and recording them on the Huawei Health app is boring, so I usually just do a quick add.</li>
<li>In the future, I hope they let us add a list of meals to the app so we can select them directly from the watch.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="activities-with-huawei-watch-gt4" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="activities-with-huawei-watch-gt4">Activities with Huawei Watch gt4</h2>
<ul>
<li>Heart rate tracking is a little slow compared to real-time detection, and sometimes when you are running and want to check your speed and heart rate, it takes around 3 seconds—quite a long time if you’re in the middle of a run!</li>
<li>The auto-detection of activities may only start after 20 minutes of walking!</li>
<li>SpO2… and then what?</li>
<li>They claim there are more than 100 exercises to choose from, but do I really use all of these 100?</li>
<li>Let’s look at the ones that are useful to me:
<ul>
<li>Outdoor run</li>
<li>Elliptical</li>
<li><strong>Jump rope</strong>: My favorite! It’s accurate and very helpful.</li>
<li>Indoor run</li>
<li>Indoor walk</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Ones I don’t use:
<ul>
<li>Outdoor cycling</li>
<li>Indoor cycling</li>
<li>Pool swimming</li>
<li>Open-water swimming</li>
<li>Mountain hiking</li>
<li>Hiking</li>
<li>Trail running</li>
<li>Skiing</li>
<li>Snowboarding</li>
<li>Cross-country skiing</li>
<li>Triathlon</li>
<li>Rowing</li>
<li>Track running</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Are these really 100 exercises?</li>
<li>Where are the gym exercises like pull-ups, push-ups, squats, bench presses, etc.?</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="syncing-with-huawei-health" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="syncing-with-huawei-health">Syncing with huawei health</h2>
<ul>
<li>You must use one main device. I have both a Huawei Health and a Huawei MatePad, but I have to log in on just one of them to sync the information. What if I want to use both? You can’t.</li>
<li>Syncing with Linux or from the web? No, you can’t do that either.</li>
<li>However, syncing is very fast.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="messages-with-huawei-gt4" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="messages-with-huawei-gt4">Messages with huawei gt4</h2>
<ul>
<li>I love the messaging feature. You can read messages in multiple languages without any problem and respond using preconfigured answers, but you can’t type on the watch.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="music-with-huawei-gt4" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="music-with-huawei-gt4">Music with huawei gt4</h2>
<ul>
<li>The music quality and sound are great, especially if you want to listen to tracks before sleeping.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="calls-with-huawei-gt4" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="calls-with-huawei-gt4">Calls with huawei gt4</h2>
<ul>
<li>Answering calls from the watch is really nice if you’re at home, but not so much if you’re outside on the street, for example.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="battery-with-huawei-gt4" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="battery-with-huawei-gt4">Battery with huawei gt4</h2>
<ul>
<li>The best thing about the watch is the battery life. I don’t worry about it at all. I charge it for 30 minutes per week, and even when I use the always-on display, the battery doesn’t drain much.</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="i-broked-the-glass-of-the-huawei-gt4">I broked the glass of the huawei gt4</h2>
<ul>
<li>The watch broke on the first day of college, probably because I pressed my hand too hard on a marble surface or something similar at the university.</li>
<li>I immediately contacted customer service, and a representative answered—I can’t remember her name—but she was incredibly polite, understanding, and helpful. I spoke to her again shortly after, and she asked me for specific information about the watch to check if it was under warranty or not. She followed up with me two days later, then again a day after that, and again two days later until I managed to get the invoice from Amazon. She tried to solve the issue by recommending an exchange and even told me which day to go when there would be discounts on the products.</li>
<li>Honestly, it was the best customer service experience I’ve ever had. She was able to go beyond being just a robot to become someone who understands, values, and helps—a human experience that brings joy.</li>
<li>At the very least, I had to document and acknowledge that she is someone exceptional. I requested to give her a rating, and I did. I’m really happy about that.</li>
<li>But I haven’t fixed the watch yet because there are no spare parts available in Egypt.</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="why-revisit-ds-and-algorithms">Why revisit DS and algorithms</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>I am a fresh graduate from AI college, i spent the last 4 years learning about both Computer science and AI.</p></li>
<li><p>I was learning some math, machine learning , Deep learning and a lot of programming with python and C++, spent some a lot of time learning web also for freelance jobs.</p></li>
<li><p>a lot of time i had multiple interviews while i was a student in the summer and all the time the questions was about linkedlist, and some medium leetcode question and a few of them was about frameworks like pytorch or pandas.</p></li>
<li><p>I faced a strange fact when i started to work on life projects or some advanced books…etc they require a strong problem solving skills that i don’t have!!</p></li>
<li><p>I am revisiting these topics and will try to get out from the juypter notebook and kaggle world in software engineer with python and focus more on open source projects.</p></li>
<li><p>I want to reazlie the time/memeory order of the data structures i am using in my projects</p></li>
<li><p>I have read the algorithm book v3 and spent 6 months on codeforces with c++ i remember these days where i could spent around 10 hours per day solving problems with myself before the AI assistants like GPT..etc i am missing the good feeling after every problem i manage to solve and i was able to write around 90 lines of code without research or AI help..etc.</p></li>
<li><p>I will start learning again about this topics and make them a daily habit to solve a problem per day: - <a href="https://www.manning.com/books/grokking-data-structures">[grokking_ds]</a> - it’s a new book about data structure in python and explained with the grokking style</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/python-ds-skills/">[DS with python]</a> - it’s a mostafa saad ibrhaim udemy course with python version with a lot of problems to solve</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://neetcode.io/roadmap">[neetcode]</a> - a roadmap to focus on some problems selected from neetcode</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://codingchallenges.fyi/">[coding challenges]</a> - A SE problems to help you focus more on how to build projects not just problem solving which will help me to start doing some open source</p></li>
</ul>
<section id="times-i-needed-ds" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="times-i-needed-ds">times i needed DS</h3>
<pre><code>- multiple time when i was trying to building some solutions related to NLP or graph neural network i know that this problem must solved with Linkedlist and this needs a type of tree then i struggle to continue....
- Learning about some NLP Algorithms or the new searching and matching techniques most of the time they are math equations with some optimizations you can't fully understand unless your skills in problem solving
- research in DL needs a huge skills in problem solving and how to understand the following architectures then update or utilize them to your needs more in this in the future but i think the better you are in SE the better you are in ML.</code></pre>

  <title>The curse of SEO</title>
  <dc:creator>kareem </dc:creator>
  <link>https://kareemai.com/blog/posts/seo/the_curse_of_seo.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 




<ul>
<li><strong>Definition:</strong> SEO is optimizing your website pages to appear in the top results of search engines like Google and Bing.
<ul>
<li>Why is this important? It makes you visible to more people who are interested in what you provide—products, services, news, etc.</li>
<li>Enough of the basics. I assume you already know what SEO is about. Now, let’s explore a darker side of being involved in SEO.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>How to Track Your Changes</strong>
<ul>
<li>Since SEO revolves around ranking, how do you track your position?</li>
<li>There are multiple tools I enjoy using, such as:
<ul>
<li><strong>I love to manually search keywords and track their ranks myself! :)</strong>
<ul>
<li>I do this often when I need a break at the gym or during study breaks.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><a href="https://www.semrush.com/">SEMrush</a>
<ul>
<li>I use it to check domain authority, organic keywords, and traffic increase.</li>
<li>Seeing green in increased Ref. Domains and Authority Score brings joy.</li>
<li><em>I don’t use it for anything else! :)</em></li>
</ul></li>
<li><a href="https://rankmath.com/">Ranking Math</a>
<ul>
<li>Say hi to the overrated WordPress SEO plugin “Ranking Math SEO”</li>
<li>It claims to simplify content optimization with built-in suggestions based on widely-accepted practices.</li>
<li>I use Rankmath Pro on a website I manage, showing impressions, total keywords, average position, and clicks. GSC offers all this for free!</li>
<li>This post isn’t about Rankmath; that’s for another time. In short:
<ul>
<li>AI tools</li>
<li>AMP</li>
<li>Analysis from Google Analytics</li>
<li>Instant indexing</li>
<li>Backlinks count</li>
<li>Local SEO</li>
<li>News sitemap</li>
<li>Podcasts</li>
<li>Schema</li>
<li>SEO analysis</li>
<li>Sitemap</li>
<li>Video Sitemap</li>
<li>WooCommerce</li>
<li>Google Web Stories</li>
</ul></li>
<li>None of these significantly impact SEO and ranking; there are other effective methods.</li>
<li>What matters most to me with Rankmath is:
<ul>
<li>Top 5 performing posts</li>
<li>Other keywords</li>
</ul></li>
<li>I mainly use Rankmath for its focus keyword section in each article.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><a href="https://mangools.com/">Mangools</a>
<ul>
<li>My preferred tool! Its UI/UX is excellent, and it’s fast and efficient unlike other tools.</li>
<li>With the free account, I get:
<ul>
<li>5 keyword researches daily</li>
<li>8 SERP checks</li>
<li>1,000 backlink analyses</li>
<li>Domain profile checks for 2 domains daily</li>
</ul></li>
<li>For Arabic, its keyword ideas aren’t as good.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><a href="https://search.google.com/search-console/about">Google Search Console</a>
<ul>
<li>A free tool by Google offering most SEO tools’ functionalities for free and accurately.</li>
<li>You get:
<ul>
<li>Performance of your website for any keyword at any time in any region!</li>
<li>Page indexing status</li>
<li>Backlink analysis</li>
<li>Page experience and more</li>
</ul></li>
<li>You might notice a recurring theme:
<ul>
<li>Charts</li>
<li>Changing numbers everywhere, numbers galore!</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><a href="https://app.neilpatel.com/">Neil Patel</a>
<ul>
<li>Rank tracking</li>
<li>SEO opportunities</li>
<li>Site audit</li>
<li>Keyword research</li>
<li>Traffic estimation</li>
<li>Backlinks</li>
</ul></li>
<li><a href="https://keywordtool.io/">Keyword Tool</a>
<ul>
<li>For Arabic, it provides the most related suggested keywords, though many aren’t quite relevant.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><a href="https://www.guinrank.com/">GuinRank</a>
<ul>
<li>New and more tailored for Arabic, gaining power.</li>
<li>I use its content and keyword tools for Arabic, providing helpful recommendations and statistics for choosing useful keywords.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><a href="https://moz.com/">Moz</a>
<ul>
<li>They even blocked my IP -__-</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Starting to Lose!</strong>
<ul>
<li>What’s going wrong? I hate losing after investing time, money, and mental health into something. If you’re like me, SEO can be crushing.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Losing Backlinks</strong>
<ul>
<li>Spam backlinks (like Khamsat, Fiverr, and Upwork)—most are harmful.</li>
<li><a href="https://khamsat.com/marketing/backlinks-building/2836532-%D8%AE%D8%B7%D8%A9-%D8%A8%D8%A7%D9%83-%D9%84%D9%8A%D9%86%D9%83-pbn-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A3%D9%81%D8%B6%D9%84-%D8%AD%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%8A%D8%A7">PBN Network</a>
<ul>
<li>This service claims safe PBNs for backlinks from Web 2.0 blogs, profiles, social bookmarking, social likes/shares, etc. I tried it, and none appeared in GSC after 3 months; worse, my site’s rank dropped.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><a href="https://khamsat.com/marketing/backlinks-building/2191705-%D8%AD%D8%B2%D9%85%D8%A9-%D8%A8%D8%A7%D9%83%D9%84%D9%8A%D9%86%D9%83-%D9%85%D8%AA%D9%83%D8%A7%D9%85%D9%84%D8%A9-%D9%84%D9%85%D9%88%D9%82%D8%B9%D9%83-%D8%B9%D9%84%D9%89-%D9%85%D9%88%D8%A7%D9%82%D8%B9-%D8%B9%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%8A%D8%A9-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AF%D9%88%D9%85%D9%8A%D9%86-%D8%A7%D8%AB%D9%88%D8%B1%D8%AA%D9%8A">Manually Added Backlinks</a>
<ul>
<li>This package offers 70 PR10 backlinks from foreign websites, 60 Arabic guest posts, and 10 EDU backlinks, etc.</li>
<li>It worked to some extent, but the impact was minimal. Four backlinks from specific places helped more than these services.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Other services are mostly spam backlinks; some guest posts might help, but aim for real backlinks spaced out from related sites.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Losing Ranking</strong>
<ul>
<li>This month, a home services website I manage improved from 65th to 9th in rankings, then disappeared, and later ranked 40th, etc.</li>
<li>This cycle repeats—a page gains rank, then drops.</li>
<li>It’s stressful; don’t check daily. Weekly (or every 2-3 weeks) is less stressful and gives fairer results, focusing on what’s important.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>What’s Going Wrong?</strong>
<ul>
<li>Watching page changes from these tools is like social media’s new “like” button!</li>
<li>My mind loves the green and red numbers.</li>
<li>Ultimately, most analyses aren’t critical. Whether 23rd or 80th, if not in the top 5, what’s the use? Daily checks yield nothing; reaching top 5 goes unnoticed until notifications and calls confirm it.</li>
<li>If SEO is your sole income source, it’s a tough job—even though it can make you a millionaire sometimes.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>How to Recover</strong>
<ul>
<li>Here’s what helped me recover from this addiction:</li>
<li>Create barriers for easy access:
<ol type="1">
<li>Separate Google accounts/tabs into another browser profile. Using Brave or Bing makes this easy.</li>
<li>Remove bookmarked tabs for these tools and clear browsing history.</li>
<li>Use extensions to block these sites; Chrome Store has many offering motivational quotes.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Delete Chrome and YouTube from mobile using <a href="https://askubuntu.com/questions/34702/how-do-i-set-up-android-adb">ADB</a>.</li>
<li>Move tool emails to spam except weekly updates from Mangools and GSC.</li>
</ul></li>

<li><strong>Final Thoughts!</strong>
<ul>
<li>As a programmer, I initially thought a fast website and quality content were key in SEO. I later learned that choosing keywords and acquiring backlinks are crucial.</li>
<li>A nice Arabic book which will give you true information about SEO <a href="https://academy.hsoub.com/files/28-%D8%AF%D9%84%D9%8A%D9%84%D9%83-%D8%A5%D9%84%D9%89-%D8%AA%D8%AD%D8%B3%D9%8A%D9%86-%D9%85%D8%AD%D8%B1%D9%83%D8%A7%D8%AA-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A8%D8%AD%D8%AB-seo/">دليلك إلي تحسين محركات البحث</a></li>
<li>Feel free to DM on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/abdelkareem-elkhateb-989a68294/">Linkedin</a></li>
<li>Ultimately, backlinks boil down to how many you buy and from whom.</li>

<p>أحد الممارسات التي أقوم بها في بعض الأحيان هي مراقبة مصادر الأفكار التي تأتيني والمحفزات لها وتتبع أثر تلك الأفكار علي أفعالي ومشاعري ، يعتبرها البعض تفكير زائد وأعتبرها أنا نعمة تنقذني أحيانا من الإستغراف في الكثير من المهام والإستيقاظ متاخرا نسبيا.</p>
<p>بدأت المشكلة في الظهور في السنة الأولي الجامعية في تلك البداية التي يحاول كل شخص أن يظهر مهاراته وقدراته ويثبت نفسه ويحاول إثارة إعجاب الأخرين وتنشاءة العلاقات مع أناس من كافة المحافظات ذلك الدخول المفاجئ والكثيف كان له أثر نفسي سئ.</p>
<p>مثل تغير الاهتمامات علي المستوي الشخص والمعرفي و الدخول في تلك العلاقات الكثيره بدأت الأهداف المركزية التي كنت أحلم بها و أفكاري ومبادئ بالتشتت والتأثر بجاذبية كل شخص تعرفت عليه وصار بيني وبينه علاقة زمالة بل وحتي مجرد رؤية صفحته علي وسائل التواصل كل هذا طبيعي و مفهوم.</p>
<p>بعد محاول مراقبة الوقت اليومي واين يتم استنافزه وأين تسنزف أفكاري و مخزون التركيز لدي وجدت أني أذهب لنشر بيت الشعر هذا وتليخص الكتاب ذاك لأنتظر رد فعل فلان وعلان و انغماسي في الردود علي منشوراتهم وتتبع أخبارهم و تضخم طفيليي الفضول عندي بشكل مبالغ فيه مما أصبح يسبب قلق وحيرة وتشتت ومقارانات و وضياع أعمار.</p>

<p>الإنبهار السريع باي شخص يتحدث عن شئ لا أعرفه مرت 6 شهور تقريبا وأنا متاثر ببعض الأشخاص الذين كنت أعتقد ان لديهم قدر من العلم والصدق والاشتراك في كورساتهم التي ستجعلني مبرمج لأحصل علي دخل بالدولار في نهاية الشهر القادم <strong>ذلك الشهر الذي أمتد 4 سنوات دراسية !!!</strong> شهر أسبوعه بمقدار عام!</p>
<p>لنرمز لتلك الفئة من المؤثرين بالرمز س وهو إختصار لكلمة سبوبة ينتشر هولاء الأشخاص في أماكن صيد المبتدائين يبيع لك هولاء الأشخاص الوعود البراقة كورس لتعلم السايبر سيكورتي في خلال 3 شهور أو تعلم دبلومة علم البيانات والذكاء الاصطناعي في شهرين تنبهر كثيرا بالكارزيما وطريقة الالقاء ونظافة المكان والمحتوي الذي يعد مبهر بالنسبة لك فلبس لديك أي آليات للحكم علي الشخص أو المحتوي فكل معرفتك في العلم هي تعال نجرب حصة عند أستاذ شكري</p>
<p>طالب لا حول له ولا قوة لا يعرف أي شئ في عقلة غير ملخص الدرس الذي يحفظة عن ظهر قلب ويذهب للامتحان ليسكب تلك الاسئلة الجاهزه في ورقة الامتحان الابله ليتفاجئ ذلك المسكين أن لا يوجد تعليم جامعي حقيقي وانها كانت كذبة العمر الضائع في كل تلك السنوات من الابتدائية وهو يسأل متي الراحة من هذا التلقين الفاشل وتكون الاجابة الكلاشكية هي أتعب الوقتي علشان تستريح بعدين بعدين امته!</p>

<p>سواء كانت نتيجة الثانوية مرضية و أرضيت والديك أم محزنة وأصابك اكتائب وامتلئت بالحزن فلا تبتأس فالقادم أسوء عليكما ومرحبا بك في عصر الكهنة الجامعية بعد مرات البحث العديدة وسماع الأراء هنا وهناك والكثير من الفيدوهات التي تذكر لك مميزات الجامعة الفلانية وأقسامها ونعيمها وتذكرك بالابتعاد عن الهندسة والجامعات التقليدية والذهاب الي كليات الجديدة مثل:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>كلية الملاحة والفضاء</li>
<li>كلية الثروة السمكية</li>
<li>والحبيبة الخبيثة كلية الذكاء الاصطناعي كلية المستقبل وصناعة الريموتات ومكن الخياطة</li>
<li>والكثير من الكليات الجديدة أو القسام ذات الأسماء البراقة “ليس عندي أي إعتراض عن أي كلية أو تخصص بل أتمني أن يكون عندي عمر لكل تخصص فشرف العلم كافي”</li>
</ol>
<p>لكن المشكلة في أنها مسرحية وسبوبة عامة وكل فرد مشارك فيها بداية من المدرسين والأهل و المهاطيل الجامعيين</p>
<p>ذلك المعبد الملئ بالالهة والكهنة والمحرمات والذي بمجرد دخولك لبوابة ذلك المعبد وتقديمك لأوراق الالتحاق فقد تمت عليك اللعنة الأبدية وكما دخلت جسد ممتلئ بالأمل أو حتي جسد ممتلئ بالحزن والندم فسرعا ما ستخرج جثة هامدة فاقدة الرغبة علي العيش بل تفقد في كثير من المرات إنسانتيك</p>

<p>ستدخل هذا الصرح الهائل المبهر في بدايته وتتوجه الي المعبد الذي لعنت به الكثير من الخدم الأكبر منك يتنصلون للبحث عن الفتيات الساذجات لإشباع شهواتهم.</p>

<p>كان التفسير الوحيد لكل هذا العبث هو وجود خطة شر كبري من الفراعنة القدماء لتوليد أكبر قدر من الطاقة السلبية والإحباط في كل مكان يجتمع فيه البشر او كان يفترض ان يكون ولادة جديدة لأرواح متعبة.</p>
<p>يتم إستخدام تلك الطاقة وإمتصاصها فهي تعني لهم الخلود فتلك المنطقة حلت عليها لعنة لا يمكن حلها إلا بالقضاء علي الفراعنة و إعادة الارواح التي أغتصبت والأحلام المفقودة أحلام البسطاء وللحديث هنا بقية في مكان وزمان أخري.</p>

<p><a href="https://ar.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D8%AC%D8%A7%D8%B0%D8%A8%D9%8A%D8%A9">الجاذبية</a> (من فعل جَذَبَ) وتعرف أيضاً باسم الثَقالة (من فعل ثَقُلَ) هي ظاهرة طبيعية يتم بواسطتها تحريك وانجذاب كل الأشياء من الكتلة أو الطاقة -بما في ذلك الكواكب والنجوم والمجرات وحتى الضوء- نحو بعضها البعض.</p>
<p>على الأرض، تعطي الجاذبية ثقلاً للأجسام المادية (الوزن)، وجاذبية القمر تسبب المد والجزر في المحيط. تسبب الانجذاب الجاذبي للمادة الغازية الأصلية الموجودة في الكون في البدء في الاندماج النووي، وتكوين النجوم -وتجميع النجوم معًا في مجرات- لذا فإن الجاذبية مسؤولة عن العديد من الهياكل الواسعة النطاق في الكون.</p>
<p>على الرغم من ذلك فإن آثار الجاذبية تصبح أضعف بشكل متزايد على الأشياء البعيدة.</p>
</section>
<section id="جاذبية-الأشياء" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="جاذبية-الأشياء">جاذبية الأشياء</h2>
<p>هل يمكنك أن تفكر كثيرا في كافة الأشياء التي تجذبك لها من حولك علي مستوي الوقت و الأفكار والمشاعر وقوة الإرادة!</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>تاثير أصدقائك عليك</li>
<li>مكان سكنك</li>
<li>أسرتك</li>
<li>وسائل التواصل</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>التركيز</strong> ليس هو قضاء أكثر وقت في أمر ما لكنه قدرتك علي إبعاد المشتات عن تلك المهمة والقدرة علي التركيز الكامل فيها. فمثلا: فمثلا التركيز هو ان تذاكر 4 ساعات برمجة فقط وليس ان تركز علي ساعتين برمجة ويب وساعة ماركتنيج وساعة مذاكرة للجامعة ومحاول التنقل بينهم علي= مدار اليوم او كما احب ان اقول علي مدار نوم!</p>
<hr>
<p>ليست القضية كم لدي من الوقت لأعمل كذا بل كم من هذا الوقت لدي القدرة علي عمل هذا فوجود 10 ساعات فراغ ليس معناه انك تستطيع إستخدامهم جميعا بل يوجد منهم مثلا 4 ساعات فقط وهذه رحلة طويلة وتحتاج لتنظيم عالي ومحاول وخطاء والكثير من النصائح ليس هذا وقت ذكرها.</p>
<p>فلهذا ينصح بالابتعاد عن وسائل التواصل و تدفق المعلومات التي تشغل عقلك وقلبك في بداية اليوم فبعد ساعتين تشعر بالصداع والرغبة علي النوم وكأن عقلك توقف عن العمل.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="حديث-تخرج">حديث تخرج</h2>
<p><img src="https://kareemai.com/blog/posts/life_style/images/chocies.png" class="img-fluid" alt="target"> مدي علي تخرجي من الجامعة بتقدير جيد جدا +B مترفع بضعة أيام تتملكني فرحة عارمة أنني قدت هربت من هذه السجون التي وضعت عليا طوالة هذه الأعوام شعور مريح جدا تبقي سجن الخدمة العسكرية اللهم إني أسالك الإعفاء من هذه التجربة ومن شرها وشر من فيها.</p>
<p>حديث تخرج في مدار جاذبية الأشياء السؤال الذي لم يتم تحديده بالكامل هو فيما سوف أتخصص الآن أفكر في إجابة منذ 3 سنوات وكل شهرين تزداد معرفتي وخبرتي وأجد أنني ليس لدي إجابة حقيقة حتي الآن. هناك 3 تخصصات أستطيع ان أبدا بها:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>مهندس برمجيات (ومن خلاله أختار فرع مثل برمجة الواجهات او الباك إند)</li>
<li>متخصص في علوم البيانات ( من خلاله أختار فرع مثل تعلم العميق والمجالات البحثية الشيقة الأخري)</li>
<li>الماركتينج + السيو + كتابة المحتوي (من خلال هو أقرب فرصة للحصول علي المال لسبب غير معلوم لن أصرح عنه) أين هي الصعوبة! الصعوبة تكمن في جاذبية كل فرع من تلك الفروع و أثر أختيار أحدهم عن الأخر من ناحية الأيجابيات والسلبيات لكلا منهما وليس هذا مكان النقاش ولكن ما أريد أن أشير له هو تأثير الإختيارات عليك و أثرها علي حياتك و وماهي أسباب ميولك الحقيقة لإختيار محدد.</li>
</ol>
<p>كيف سأختار الآن في الحقيقة قد أخرت ان أحجم جذب كل تخصص منهم لي في الفترة الحالية بالقدر الذي أرسمه لنفسي ومحاول الإلتزام بذلك والجمع بينهم للخروج بأفضل إستفادة ممكنة.</p>

<p>بعض الأمثلة التي أتذكرها و أجد فيها إستغراق أصحابها في كثير من الأوقات بغير قصد ونكران شديد لما يفعلون وهذا ما أخاف و أحاذر منه.</p>
<section id="الجيم" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="الجيم">الجيم</h3>
<p>في صباح اليوم دخل شخص أول مره أراه في الجيم يبدو متمرس في كمال الأجسام له نفسي عمري تقريبا يمشي مثل الحصان بشكل مريب تشعر كأن يريد أن يخبط في أي شئ أمامه ولديه إبتسامة عريضه طوال الوقت وعينيه تنظر لكل من حوله بشكل مريب وكأنه تقول هل تراني! أو هو كذا قرائها عقلي طوال الساعتين التي قضاهم بجانبي يصرخ بصوت عالي أعلي من روني كولمان بشكل مريب برغم أن الاثقال التي يتمرن بها قريبة جدا وأحيانا أقل من التي أتمرن بها و تعامله مع الأوزان غريب بحق يرفع البار الحديدي لأعلي ويسقطه علي الأرض بقوه ولديه هوس بالصراخ والتكسير حتي أن من يبعده دورين يستيطع سماعة ومن يسكن في الدور او يمشي في الشارع ونحن في الدور ال3 يستطيع سماعة بصوت واضح فياتري ماهو مصدر الجاذبية والمحرك لهذه الأفعال التي لم تستطيع كلماتي وصف الهمجية و الإزعاج المبتذل اليوم</p>
</section>
<section id="الجامعة" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="الجامعة">الجامعة</h3>
<p>يحضرني ذكر مثالين منتشرين طالب الإتحاد او الأنشطة الطالبية الكثيره</p>
<section id="إتحاد-الطلبة-والأنشطة-الطلابية" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="إتحاد-الطلبة-والأنشطة-الطلابية">إتحاد الطلبة والأنشطة الطلابية</h4>
<p>ذلك الطلاب صاحب البدلة الأنيقة والإبتسامة العريضة الذي يشغل نفسه في الإحتفالات والتنظيمات والممارسات الإجتماعية الكثير وتنظيم الندوات والكثير من هذا النفاق (أتحدث عن الواقع الجامعي لعام 2024) الأمر يشبه مسرحية سخيفة يصبح فيها هذا الطالب البائس يرقص علي هذا المسرح المزيف ويظن أنه بطل الفيلم وسوف ينتصر في النهاية ولكن كل المعتطيات تصرح بأنه مهرج بإمتياز ويخادع نفسه.</p>
</section>
<section id="أذكي-شخص-في-عالمه" class="level4">

<p>ذلك الزميل الذي تجدة يحاول بإستمرار أن يثبت لك أنه أذكي منك وأذكي من أي أحد في الغرفة وعلي بعد 100 كيلو متر من مركز وقوفه.</p>
<p>ذلك الزميل ينعمس في صوت الأيجو الذي بداخله فتجده ينعرف عن البوصلة الصحيحه لتحصيل العلم بشكل رأسي وأفقي بتوازن حقيقي ليصل الي مرحلة من إتقان العلم و الحصول علي وظيفة مريحة كم أشعر بالحزن عليه فلديه الكثير من الطاقة ولكنه يستغلها بشكل ربما يكون خاطئ و مؤكد أنه مزعج أيضا!</p>
<p>المؤسف انه بعد مرور بعد الوقت يبدا كل شخص منا في جمع معلومات في التخصص الذي يعجبه والإلتحاق بوظائف وصديقنا لا يزال في سراب أذكي شخص في العالم ومحاولاته المستمره بدون قصد لتبيان ذلك أصبحت مزعجة وأصبحت معرفته التي أكثرها أفقية مصدر إزعاج ونوع من أنواع التباهي المثير للشفقة والغضب أحيانا! يمكن التفكير في جاذبية الإيجو عليك وخداعك لنفسك في الحاليتن والتفصيل كثير وليس الغرض التعميم.</p>
<p><strong>مقترحات للخروج من هذا الفخ</strong></p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>راقب وقتك علي وسائل التواصل الأجتماعي وليس المقصد كم تجلس علي هذه المنصات ولكن أنظر الي تعلقياتك و منشوراتك ستجد أن أكثر شخص تتحدث عنه بشكل صريح أو خفي هو كم أنت عبقري وتفهم ما لايفهمه الأخرين! كم أنت ذكي! ستجدك متقوقع علي ذاتك!</p></li>
<li><p>الإنسحاب من مراقبة و أعين الناس و محاسبة النفس بشكل أكثر حزم و الأنسحاب هنا مقصود به وسائل التواصل و التجمعات التي تظهر فيه تلك الأفعال مثل مذاكرتك في نفس غرفة السكن الجامعي أمام أصدقائك و سؤالك المستمر للأخرين هل تعرف ماهي نظرية الهتوانا مطاطا ! و دعني أشرح لك كم صعوبة هذه النظرية وعبقريتها ..الخ</p></li>
<li><p>لا تترك إشارات للاخرين مثل الاهتمام الزائد بحالات الواتس والتيليجرام وإظهار المستمر لماذا تفعل مثل ديسكورد والأغاني التي تستمع لها</p></li>

<section id="هوس-الجمال" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="هوس-الجمال">هوس الجمال</h3>
<p>هوس الجمال تلك الفتاة التي كل إهتمامها هو جمالها والجمال والثروة والمال تجد أنه مهوسة بالجانب البصري عندها بشكل يجعلك تظنها ماكيت مخيف من الإنجذاب للماديات بشكل يطغي علي جمالها كأنثي يصل الأمر الي إلغاء الهالة المحيطة بها كأم أو زوجة أو فتاة عموما تشعر.</p>
<p>مشاهدة الإستغرام والتيك توك بشكل مكثف ومحاولة تقليد الترندات والمشاهير والإنغماس في أخبارهم… بعد مرور بعض الوقت تجد أنك امام فتاة لا تدري أي شئ عن كونها فتاة غير جسدها وجمالها حتي هذا يصل بشكل خاطئي.</p>

<p>المشكلة ليست في الأنجذاب لشئ فهذا مستحيل حدوثه لكن المشكلة هل أنا فعلا أسير في المدار الصحيح الذي يتفق مع الغاية الكبري بأفضل شكل ممكن وهل توجد محاولة التحسين المستمر أم أنك تتركها للظروف وتلعب دور المفعول به! هل فعلا بعد ذهاب العمر هل هذا هو ما كنت تود أنك أمضيت فيه عمرك! الخطر يكمن أن هذا كله يحدث من شد وجذب بدون أن تتدرك في أي فضاء صار قمرك.</p>

<p><strong>طعام الروح</strong> : كما أن الجسد له غذاءة فالجسد خلق من طين تجد أن روحك تثقل وتزداد جاذبية الدنيا وشهواتها لك و كذلك فروحك لها غذاء وهو الذكر فالذكر غذاء روحك كلما أكثرت منه ارتفعت روحك الي الأعلي وخفة جاذبية الأرض لك.</p>

<p>بعض الحلول التي مازالت محل البحث والتجربة.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>سل نفسك ماهو المحرك الحقيقي لهذا الفعل او المهمة الحالية وبأي نية أفعلها</li>
<li>ماهي المشاعر المحركة لهذا العمل ومن هو مصدرها هل هم الأهل أم فتاة أم كلمة قالها احد ما ونسي ما قال!</li>
<li>هل تستحق كل هذا الوقت والمجهود فهذا الرصيد من عمري الذي لا يعوض!</li>
<li>هل هي حقا تقع في باب أهم الأشياء التي يجب ان افعلها ام هي شواغل تعترض الطريق</li>
<li>متابعة الوقت بفعالية من التطبيقات المقترحة لهذا :

<p>مقولة مميزة من “د/عبد الرحمن المسيري”</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>وفي الرياض تفرغت تماما للموسوعة ..، وكنت أحرر بابا أسبوعيا بعنوان “إسرائيليات معاصرة” في جريدة الرياض، ولكني لاحظت أن انشغالي بالحدث اليومي بدأ يقوض من رؤيتي البانورامية الموسوعية، التي تركز علي الثوابت، والتي تتطلب إيقاعا بطئيًا، واهتمامًا بموضوعات تاريخية وفلسفية وجوانب استراتجية ربما لا تكون لها علاقة بمشارة بالحدث اليومي، ولذا توقفت عن تحرير هذا الباب) المسيري رحلتي الفكرية صفحة 539</p>

<p>I spend on average 8 hours on my laptop “kobo” doing a lot of programming, machine learning experiments and browsing many taps.</p>

<p>I have been using it for 4 years now, and it was a nice period i love that it hasn’t broken till now, everything is working good even the battery can stand for the 2.5 hours in the battery life with a lot of memory and cpu usage</p>

<p>After buying it, it wasn’t configured with Windows, but was another DOS version so I had to install a Windows version on it. After 1 week I get a lot of errors on it with the external monitor and the WiFi stops working or is not configured. I tried every Hindi video about this problem and gave it to specialists to try it, but in vain, the problem happened again and again.</p>
<p><strong>The solution:</strong> It was my first year at a computer science college, so the geeky thing was to use Linux. After some search, I installed Ubuntu and then tried a lot of distros like Void Linux, but the one that I picked and still use is the amazing PopOS! which is based on Ubuntu but better than it!<br>
The WiFi problem doesn’t appear again! And for Nvidia graphics, it’s solved in PopOS! which has a command to install some drivers. And everything works smoothly</p>

<section id="the-cost-of-it" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-cost-of-it">The Cost of It!</h3>
<p>I bought it for the cost of 20,000 EGP, which at the time I bought it was $X, but now 20,000 EGP is worth $XX due to problems in my country.</p>
<p>Its cost at that time is really high for my budget and family, but I insisted on buying it because I knew it would stay with me for years, so I wanted a good one.</p>
</section>
<section id="how-i-decided-to-buy-it" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="how-i-decided-to-buy-it">How I Decided to Buy It!</h3>
<p>The phrase “Machine learning needs an Nvidia GPU” was dancing in my mind, so my main focus was on a nice GPU card in a laptop with a low budget. After some search, I found that the best choices are MSI or Lenovo, but the Lenovo version cost about 4000 EGP more than the MSI.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>I tested the keyboard of the Lenovo, and every time I felt like I wanted to cut my fingers off</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It wasn’t available online, so I had to travel 3 hours to the store that sells it. It was a nice experience to buy something I wanted instead of a random gift from my father.</p>

<section id="i-am-not-a-gamer" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="i-am-not-a-gamer">I Am Not a Gamer!</h2>
<p>I didn’t use it for gaming because I am not a gamer, but I used it heavily in programming and some machine learning and basic computer vision models, and it works so nicely!</p>
</section>
<section id="kobo-for-ml" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="kobo-for-ml">Kobo for ML</h2>
<p><img src="https://kareemai.com/blog/posts/mteb_encoding/dragon_3.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Kobo"> Machine learning is a wide area, and you can use the GPU for 3 things:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Train a model from scratch</li>
<li>Fine-tune a model</li>
<li>Evaluate a model (inference)</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><strong>Train</strong> a model from scratch was an ideal task for such a GPU, but I was doing it for multiple computer vision classification tasks, learning new architectures, trying to build…etc. For ML you don’t always need a GPU but for deep learning, which is a subset of ML that uses more connected layers (which means more computing power and memory needs), you do.</li>
<li><strong>Fine-tune</strong> a model is the case I used the most - I download a trained model and try to make it work better on my data. What you need here is enough GPU RAM - in my case it’s a 6GB card. This worked fine with computer vision algorithms and classic NLP models with less than 1 billion parameters. There’s no chance to try the LLAMAS models on such a card!</li>
<li><strong>Evaluate</strong> a model means to just load the model and not fine-tune it.</li>
</ul>
<p>I was fine with all the ML tasks I tried to do, unless I opened the door to large language models like the GPT family (ChatGPT for example). These models require a lot of memory and need a good graphics card like an RTX 30 or 40 series to test, and there’s no chance to train these models on any RTX card!</p>
<section id="why-not-just-use-the-cloud" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="why-not-just-use-the-cloud">Why Not Just Use the Cloud!</h3>
<p>There are two main solutions:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Kaggle
<ul>
<li>Kaggle has two GPU options, and I used it a lot, especially if the data was already hosted on Kaggle and was more than 10GB. Other than that, I downloaded a sample of the data and did my work on my own environment with CLI commands and VS Code configurations. This helped me a lot compared to just using the Kaggle editor, and it’s faster too! Sometimes the Kaggle kernel panics or just stops responding entirely!</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Colab
<ul>
<li>Colab restarts after 4 hours and your work can get lost, and lots of annoying things like that happen a lot.</li>
<li>You have to pay for the GPU version. You get a number of hours to try it out, and it’s faster than my GTX 1660 by a good margin.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<p>But I didn’t love these cloud solutions, and I found having my own local setup to be faster and more comfortable.</p>
</section>
</section>
<section id="kobo-for-web-development" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="kobo-for-web-development">Kobo for Web Development</h2>
<p>I sometimes work on web projects (Django and JavaScript frameworks, especially AstroJS). I never had any issues building and testing web projects - everything worked nicely and efficiently.</p>
</section>
<section id="the-battery-life" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-battery-life">The Battery Life</h2>
<p>The battery life can keep it working for 2.5 hours when the power is out if you switch to battery saver mode. I don’t think it could last more than 1 hour in normal mode! This is the laptop’s biggest issue. Sometimes it powers off even when fully charged if you do a lot of computation without plugging it in.</p>
</section>
<section id="the-heat" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-heat">The Heat</h2>
<p><img src="https://kareemai.com/blog/posts/mteb_encoding/dragon_4.png" class="img-fluid" alt="target"> I didn’t find heat to be a problem or even the fan noise in most of my work. But sometimes when running a deep learning model, the fan noise is a bit loud and it does get really hot. For normal coding and browsing though, there are no issues and the cooling system is fast. Overall I didn’t find heat to be a major problem.</p>
</section>
<section id="the-keyboard" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-keyboard">The Keyboard</h2>
<p>The keyboard is very responsive and well configured with smooth clicks - no issues or sticky keys even though I have fat fingers!</p>
<p>I’ve been using this machine for 4 years and I write a lot. No broken keys have happened despite my clumsy fingers. I have a mechanical keyboard that I sometimes use, but I always miss the feel of the built-in keyboard. The red backlight is decent.</p>
</section>
<section id="finally" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="finally">Finally!</h2>
<p><img src="https://kareemai.com/blog/posts/mteb_encoding/draong_1.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Kobo_finally"> I just wanted to say that I love “Kobo” and I’ve spent nice times with it - some really difficult and others really happy. It’s been a loyal friend and something to rely on.</p>

<section id="intro" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="intro">Intro</h2>
<p>Hi, In this fast blog i will talk about my review with Huawei Freebuds 5i, which is the first noise-cancelling earbuds i have tried. This is not an ad or even affiliate product, it’s my own review for fun and just seeking of knowledge. <img src="https://consumer.huawei.com/content/dam/huawei-cbg-site/common/mkt/pdp/headphones/freebuds5i/imges/huawei-freebuds-5i-kv.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="freebuds"></p>
</section>
<section id="who-am-i" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="who-am-i">Who am i !</h2>
<ul>
<li>I am Kareem, a college student interested in machine learning and web technology.</li>
<li>I enjoy working deeply and seeking out quiet places, but I live in an area with some noisy disturbances in the mornings - people walking down the street, kids playing around the house, street vendors - which often interrupt my focus and break my state of flow.</li>
<li>I wish there was a solution to block out all these sounds so I could live in an isolated place free of annoying noises! Using noise-cancelling headphones or heading into outer space would be ideal environments with no bothersome sounds around.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="how-i-bought-it" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="how-i-bought-it">how i bought it</h2>
<ul>
<li>I bought it from amazon prime, and it cost me around 100$ or 3,200 pounds. It reached within two days.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="first-impressions" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="first-impressions">First impressions</h2>
<ul>
<li>Upon unboxing and using it for the first time, I was genuinely pleased with the initial track I played.</li>
<li>The sound quality was noticeably superior compared to my phone or any other earbuds I’ve previously used. I then tested the noise-cancelling feature and was amazed when I couldn’t hear my younger brother calling me.</li>
<li>The street noises were effectively blocked out, with only a faint hum reaching my ears, which was quite tolerable. Initially, the earbud tips were a bit uncomfortable, but after switching to a smaller size, the discomfort was resolved. Everything seemed perfect, except for a slight pressure in my ears when using the noise-cancelling feature, particularly noticeable the following morning. Despite this, my ears seem to crave the earbuds and my skin seems to miss them when they’re not in use. This can be a bit of a downside, but it’s not always the case.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="is-noise-cancelling-actually-work" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="is-noise-cancelling-actually-work">Is noise cancelling actually work ?</h2>
<p>I’ve used these earbuds in various settings:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Subway: The noise-cancelling feature combined with my music created an immersive experience, effectively blocking out any other sounds and allowing me to enjoy my tunes in peace.</p></li>
<li><p>College: Amidst the chatter and shouts of other students, I was able to retreat into my own world of sound.</p></li>
<li><p>Bus: The noise of the bus engine was successfully blocked out, but I could still hear the conversations of those sitting next to me. It wasn’t overly bothersome, but it didn’t provide complete isolation.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>In summary, the noise-cancelling feature works well, but it doesn’t provide absolute silence. I can still hear some ambient sounds. One noticeable issue is that when I make calls using the earbuds, I can hear the other person clearly, but they often complain about the clarity of my voice. They say it sounds distant and unclear, sometimes even asking to call back later. This issue is particularly prevalent when I’m on the bus.</p>
</section>
<section id="the-modes-of-the-freebuds-and" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-modes-of-the-freebuds-and">the modes of the Freebuds and</h2>
<p>Here is a rephrased version of the key points about the Huawei Freebuds 5i’s features:</p>
<p><strong>Noise Cancellation Modes:</strong></p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Noise Cancelling Mode</strong>: Actively cancels out ambient noise. Uses more battery power.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Off Mode</strong>: No active noise cancellation, but still provides some passive noise isolation. Less battery usage.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Awareness Mode</strong>: Allows ambient sounds to be heard clearly. Useful for hearing announcements at the gym or people talking to you. However, my own voice sounds muted in this mode, so I have to remove the earbuds temporarily to hold conversations.</p></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Sound Quality Presets:</strong></p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><em>Default</em>: No sound enhancements applied.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Treble Boost</em>: Boosts treble frequencies. I haven’t used this.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Bass Boost</em>: Emphasizes bass when listening to music like hip-hop.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Voices</em>: Optimizes sound for speech clarity. I use this for podcasts.</p></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Connection Priority Modes:</strong></p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Balance Mode</strong>: Balances audio quality and connection stability.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Sound Quality Priority</strong>: Prioritizes sound quality over connectivity. Uses more power which may cause occasional lag.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>I have not noticed any discernible difference between these two modes, so I just use the Balance mode.</p>
</section>
<section id="the-gestures" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-gestures">The Gestures</h2>
<p>The Huawei Freebuds 5i offer various gesture controls:</p>
<ul>
<li>Double-tap, Triple-tap, Press &amp; hold, Swipe</li>
</ul>
<p>I particularly enjoy the swipe gesture for volume control, as it works smoothly. The press and hold gesture is a bit slow, and the triple-tap gesture can be annoying since tapping your ear three times isn’t very comfortable.</p>
<p>Occasionally, the Freebuds don’t recognize when I’ve inserted the left or right earbud, and I continue listening with just one earbud without realizing the other isn’t connected. This doesn’t happen often, though.</p>
</section>
<section id="the-compatibility-with-other-devices" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-compatibility-with-other-devices">The compatibility with other devices</h2>
<ul>
<li>I love how it connect with both the phone and tablet without any problems or conflict</li>
<li>I’ve been using the Freebuds with my Realme phone, MSI Linux laptop, and Huawei Mate Pad 11.</li>
<li>The connection with the Realme phone is seamless, regardless of whether the AI Life application is used or not.</li>
<li>When it comes to the Huawei Mate Pad 11, there’s a feature that allows you to adjust settings directly from the Bluetooth menu. This is a functionality that isn’t available on standard Android devices without the AI Life app.</li>
</ul>
<section id="linux-connection" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="linux-connection">Linux connection</h3>
<p>I’ve connected the Freebuds to my Linux laptop using the ‘<a href="https://smarttech101.com/bluetoothctl-management-of-bluetooth-devices-in-linux/">bluetoothctl</a>’ command. However, I’ve encountered an issue where I need to restart Bluetooth each time I want to establish a connection for it to work properly</p>
</section>
</section>
<section id="the-case-and-overall-design" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-case-and-overall-design">The case and overall design</h2>
<ul>
<li>The design of the Freebuds is truly appealing. It has a unique aesthetic that sets it apart from other earbuds, giving it a premium feel.</li>
<li>In terms of design, the FreeBuds 5i bear a resemblance to the 4i model, but they are 11% lighter and have shorter stems. They come with an IP54 rating, making them dust-tight and splash-resistant. The color options include a new “Isle Blue”, along with “Nebula Black” and “Ceramic White”. The package includes small, medium, and large silicone eartips, as well as a short USB-C cable for charging the case.</li>
<li>I love the sound of closing it, it’s a loud sound but lovely :)</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="the-battery" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-battery">The battery</h2>
<ul>
<li>The battery is really nice; I haven’t felt that I am missing the need to recharge it or that it has gone off at any time.</li>

  <description><![CDATA[ 




<section id="introduction" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>#defintion MTEB: MTEB spans 8 embedding tasks covering a total of 58 datasets and 112 languages. Through the benchmarking of 33 models on MTEB.</p>
</section>
<section id="embedding-models" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="embedding-models">Embedding models</h2>
<ul>
<li>Text embedding models like GLove lack context awareness and ar=e thus commonly labeled as word embedding model. They consist of a layer mapping each input word to a vector often followed by an averaging layer to provide a final embedding invariant of input length.</li>
<li>Transformers inject context awareness into language models via self-attention and form the foundation of most recent embedding models.
<ul>
<li>BERT uses the transformer architecture and performs large-scale self-supervised pre-training. The resulting model can directly be used to produce text embeddings via an averaging operation alike Glove.</li>
<li>SBERT be beneficial to perform additional fine-tuning of the transformer for competitive embedding performance.</li>
<li><em>Most recent fine-tuned embedding models use a contrastive loss objective to perform supervised fine-tuned on positive and negative text pairs</em></li>
<li>#critique Due to the large variety of available pretrained transformers,there is an at least equally large variety of potential text embedding models to be explored.This leads to confusion about which model provides practitioners with the best performance for their embedding use case.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<hr>
</section>
<section id="the-problem" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-problem">The problem</h2>
<ul>
<li>The problem with the current evaluation regime of current text embedding models rarely covers the breadth of their possible use cases.
<ul>
<li>#example SimCSE or SBERT solely evaluate on STS and classification tasks,leaving open questions about the transfer ability of the embedding models to search or clustering tasks.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>evaluating embedding methods on many tasks requires implementing multiple evaluation pipelines.</li>
<li>implementation details like preprocessing or hyperparameters may influence the results making it unclear whether performance improvements simply come from a favorable evaluation pipeline. This leads to the “blind” application of these models to new use cases in industry or requires incremental work to reevaluate them on different tasks.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
</section>
<section id="the-solution-with-this-benchmark" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-solution-with-this-benchmark">The solution with this benchmark</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>MTEB</strong> consists of 58 datasets covering 112 languages from 8 embedding tasks:</li>
</ul>
<ol type="1">
<li>Bitext mining</li>
<li>classification</li>
<li>clustering</li>
<li>pair classification</li>
<li>reranking, retrieval</li>
<li>STS</li>
<li>summarization.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>MTEB software is available open-source1 enabling evaluation of any embedding model by adding less than 10 lines of code.</li>
<li>Datasets and the MTEB leaderboard are available on the Hugging Face Hub2 .</li>
<li>We evaluate over 30 models on MTEB with additional speed and memory benchmarking to provide a holistic view of the state of text embedding models. We cover both models available open-source as well as models accessible via APIs, such as the OpenAI Embeddings endpoint</li>
<li>It aims to sheds light on the weaknesses and strenghts of individual models,such as SimCSE’s<a href="https://doi.org/10.48550/ARXIV.2004.07180">(Gao et al., 2021b)</a> low performance on clustering and retrieval despite its strong performance on STS.</li>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="tasks-and-evaluation">Tasks and Evaluation</h2>
<p>#definition <strong>Bitext Mining</strong><br>
Inputs are two sets of sentences from two different languages. For each sentence in the first set, the best match in the second set needs to be found.</p>
<ul>
<li>The matches are commonly translations.</li>
<li>The Provided model i used to embed each sentence and the closest pairs are found via cosine similarity</li>
<li>F1 serves as the main metric for bitext mining.Accuracy, precision and recall are also computed. #definition <strong>Classification</strong></li>
<li>A train and test set are embedded with the provided model.</li>
<li>The train set embeddings are used to train a logistic regression classifier with 100 maximum iterations, which is scored on the test set.</li>
<li>The main metric is accuracy with average precision and f1 additionally provided. #definition <strong>Clustering</strong> Given a set of sentences or paragraphs, the goal is to group them into meaningful clusters.</li>
<li>A mini-batch k-means model with batch size 32 and k equal to the number of different labels is trained on the embedded texts.</li>
<li>The model scored using V-measure - V-measure does not depend on the cluster label,thus the permutation of labels does not affect the score. #definition <strong>Classification</strong> A pair of text inputs is provided and a label needs to be assigned. Labels are typically binary variables denoting duplicate or paraphrase pairs.</li>
<li>The two texts are embedded and their distance is computed with various metrics (cosine similarity, dot product, euclidean distance, manhattan distance).</li>
<li>Using the best binary thresh- old accuracy, average precision, f1, precision and recall are computed.</li>
<li>The average precision score based on cosine similarity is the main metric. #definition <strong>Reranking</strong> : Inputs are a query and a list of relevant and irrelevant reference texts. The aim is to rank the results according to their relevance to the query.</li>
<li>The model is used to embed the references which are then compared to the query using cosine similarity.</li>
<li>The resulting ranking is scored for each query and averaged across all queries.</li>
<li>Metrics are mean MRR@k and MAP with the latter being the main metric. #definition <strong>Retrieval</strong> Each dataset consists of a corpus, queries and a mapping for each query to relevant documents from the corpus.</li>
<li>The aim is to find these relevant documents.</li>
<li>The provided model is used to embed all queries and all corpus documents and similarity scores are computed using cosine similarity. After ranking the corpus documents for each query based on the scores, nDCG@k, MRR@k, MAP@k, precision@k and recall@k are computed for several values of k. nDCG@10 serves as the main metric.</li>
<li>MTEB reuses datasets and evaluation from BEIR (Thakur et al., 2021). #definition <strong>Semantic Textual Similarity (STS)</strong> Given a sentence pair the aim is to determine their similarity. Labels are continuous scores with higher numbers indicating more similar sentences.</li>
<li>The provided model is used to embed the sentences and their similarity is computed using various distance metrics.</li>
<li>Distances are benchmarked with ground truth similarities using Pearson and Spearman correlations.</li>
<li>Spearman correlation based on cosine similarity serves as the main metric (Reimers et al.,2016). #definition <strong>Summarization</strong> A set of human-written and machine-generated summaries are provided. The aim is to score the machine summaries. The provided model is first used to embed all summaries. For each machine summary embedding, distances to all human summary embeddings are computed. The closest score (e.g.&nbsp;highest cosine similarity) is kept and used as the model’s score of a single machine-generated summary. Pearson and Spearman correlations with ground truth human assessments of the machine-generated summaries are computed. Like for STS, Spearman correlation based on cosine similarity serves as the main metric</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>#sidenote <strong>Non-Transformers</strong> : LASER (Heffernan et al.,2022) is the only context aware non-transformer model we benchmark, relying on an LSTM (Hochreiter and Schmidhuber, 1997) instead. Similar to LaBSE, the model trains on parallel data and focuses on bitext mining applications. ![[Pasted image 20231028124555.png]]</p>

<section id="analysis" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="analysis">Analysis</h2>
<ul>
<li>we observe that there is considerable variability between tasks. No model claims the state-of-the-art in all seven English tasks.</li>
<li>There is even more variability in the results per dataset present in the appendix.</li>
<li>Further, there remains a large gap between self-supervised and supervised methods.</li>
<li>Self-supervised large language models have been able to close this gap in many natural language generation tasks (Chowd- hery et al., 2022).</li>
<li>However, they appear to still require supervised fine-tuning for competitive em- bedding performance.</li>
<li>We find that performance strongly coorelates with model size, A majority of MTEB tasks are domainted by multi-billion parameter models.However, these come at a significant cost</li>
<li><strong>For classification</strong>
<ul>
<li>ST5 models dominate the classification task across most datasets</li>
<li>ST5-XXL has the highest average performance, 3% ahead of the best non-ST5 model, OpenAI Ada Similarity</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Clustering</strong>
<ul>
<li>Despite being almost 50x smaller, the MPNet embedding model is on par with the ST5- XXL state-of-the-art on Clustering. This may be due to the large variety of datasets MPNet (and MiniLM) has been fine-tuned on.</li>
<li>Clustering requires coherent distances between a large number of embeddings.</li>
<li>Models like SimCSE-sup or SGPTnli, which are only fine-tuned on a single dataset,NLI, may produce incoherent embeddings when encountering topics unseen during fine-tuning.</li>
<li>Relatedly, we find that the query embeddings of SGPT-msmarco and the Ada Search endpoint are competitive with SGPT-nli and the Ada Similarity endpoint,respectively.</li>
<li>We refer to the public leaderboard5 for Ada Search results. This could be due to the MSMARCO dataset being significantly larger than NLI.</li>
<li>Thus, while the OpenAI docs recommend using the similarity embeddings for clustering use cases6 , the retrieval query embeddings may be the better choice in some cases.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Pair Classification</strong>
<ul>
<li>GTR-XL and GTR-XXL have the strongest performance. Pair classification is closest to STS in its framing, yet models rank significantly differently on the two tasks. This highlights the importance of benchmarking on a diverse set of tasks to avoid blindly reusing a model for a different task.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Reranking</strong>
<ul>
<li>MPNet and MiniLM models perform strongly on reranking tasks.</li>
<li>On SciDocsRR (Co-han et al., 2020a) they perform far better than big- ger models, which is likely due to parts of SciDocsRR being included in their training data.</li>
<li>Our scale of experiments and that of model pre-training make controlling for data contamination challenging.</li>
<li>Thus, we ignore overlap of MTEB datasets with model training datasets in MTEB scores.</li>
<li>As long as enough datasets are averaged, we believe these effects to be insignificant.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Retrieval</strong>
<ul>
<li>SGPT-5.8B-msmarco is the best em- bedding model on the BEIR subset in MTEB as well as on the full BEIR benchmark (Thakur et al., 2021; Muennighoff, 2022).</li>
<li>The even larger 7.1B SGPT model making use of BLOOM (Scao et al., 2022) performs significantly weaker, which is likely due to the multilinguality of BLOOM.</li>
<li>Models geared towards STS (SimCSE, ST5, SGPT- nli) perform badly on retrieval tasks.</li>
<li>Retrieval tasks are unique in that there are two distinct types of texts: Queries and documents (“asymmetric”), while other tasks only have a single type of text (“symmetric”).</li>
<li>On the QuoraRetrieval dataset, which has been shown to be largely symmetric (Muennighoff, 2022), the playing field is more even with SGPT-5.8B-nli outperforming SGPT- 5.8B-msmarco,</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>STS &amp; Summarization</strong>
<ul>
<li>Retrieval models (GTR, SGPT-msmarco) perform badly on STS, while ST5-XXL has the highest performance.</li>
<li>This highlights the bifurcation of the field into separate embedding models for retrieval (asymmetric) and similarity (symmetric) use cases (Muennighoff, 2022).</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Maximum speed</strong> -&gt; Word Embedding models offer maximum speed with Glove taking the lead on both performance and speed, thus making the choice simple in this case</p>
<p><strong>Maximum performance</strong> -&gt; If latency is less important than performance Depending on the task at hand, GTR-XXL, ST5-XXL or SGPT-5.8B may be the right choice,</p>

<ol type="1">
<li>I am blogging to establish a presence on the internet and hope to collaborate with people who are interested in what I write or think about (reducing the search space by reversing the process).</li>
<li>It serves as a resume and blueprint for my existence in this world.</li>
<li>My goal is to help others by providing valuable content that makes their lives easier and better.</li>
<li>Organizing my knowledge and recapping topics I’ve forgotten helps me experience “aha” moments! 💡
<ol type="1">
<li>It’s a test of whether I truly understand something or not.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>I don’t like social media posts, Facebook, Twitter, or LinkedIn articles. I believe these platforms are not the best places for technical blogs, and their disadvantages outweigh the advantages.</li>
<li>I value the freedom of speech. Some topics or thoughts may be censored on social media, but I want to express my opinions without restrictions from others whose opinions I may not respect.</li>
<li>I want to discuss topics while I’m learning them because they’re still fresh in my mind. This will help anyone in a similar position as me in the future.</li>
<li>When studying a topic and knowing that I can write about it on my blog, I find my mind more focused on details that would fit well in the blog. This makes the learning process more enjoyable, focused, and valuable.</li>
<li>I want my posts and knowledge to be more organized!
<ol type="1">

  <title>What is an Array ?</title>
  <link>https://kareemai.com/blog/posts/ds_and_algo/Static_array.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 




<ul>
<li>Static array organize data by holding a collection of elements and making them accessible through an index</li>
<li>We use them to store and iterate over, or manipulate a collection of values of the same type without knowing much about how the individual values are correlated.</li>
<li>you can store integers, fractions, strings and other types of objects.</li>
</ul>
<section id="what-is-adt" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="what-is-adt">What is ADT ?</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li>ADTs are a theoretical concept. more like logical/mathematical view
<ol type="1">
<li>we specify the what part and also potentially the expected performance</li>
<li>It’s independent of a programming language and how it wil be implemented</li>
</ol></li>
<li>E.g Providing a append functionality with capacity enchancement</li>
<li>ADT are acting like an interface</li>
</ol>
<section id="adt-of-array" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="adt-of-array">ADT of Array</h3>
<ol type="1">
<li>Stores a collection of data</li>
<li>its elements can be accessed by index</li>
<li>Elements don’t have to be accessed sequentailly; you can get the 10th element wihtout having to read all previous elements before it</li>
</ol>

<section id="core-features-of-array" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="core-features-of-array">Core features of Array</h3>
<ol type="1">
<li>Arrays are allocated in memoery as a single, uninterrupted block of memory with sequential locations, which is both memory and time efficient</li>
<li>Arrays are restricted to storing data of the same type. This restrication also stems from the need for optimization because it allows the same memory to be allocated for each element in the array and the compiler/interpreter to quickly know the memory address of each element.</li>
<li>The size of arrays, that is the number of elements contained in an array, must be decided when the array is created, and that size can’t be changed.</li>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="arrays-in-python">Arrays in python</h2>
<ul>
<li>python offers the <code>list</code> class as its native array-like solution but it’s a dynamic not static</li>
<li>The closest to array in python is the Python’s array module, which enforces type consistency but is still a dynamic array.</li>
<li>Numpy library is the most similar to static arrays and it’s efficient</li>

<p>• To evaluate the performance of an algorithm, we can use asymptotic analysis, which means finding out a formula, expressed in big-O notation, that describes the behavior of the algorithm on the RAM model.</p>
<p>• The RAM model is a simplified computational model of a generic computer that provides only a limited set of basic instructions, all of which take constant time.</p>
<p>• Big-O notation is used to classify functions based on their asymptotic growth. We use these classes of functions to express how fast the running time or memory used by an algorithm grows as the input becomes larger.</p>
<p>• Some of the most common classes of functions, the ones you will see more often are</p>
<pre><code>– O(1)–constant—Whenever a resource grows independently of n (for example, a basic instruction).

– O(log(n))–logarithmic—Slow growth, like binary search.

– O(n)–linear—A function that grows at the same rate as the input, like the number of comparisons you need in a linear search.

– O(n*log(n))–linearithmic—We’ll see this order of growth for priority queues.

– O(n2)–quadratic—Functions in this class grow too fast for resources to be manageable beyond about a million elements. An example is the number of pairs in an array.

– O(2n)–exponential—Functions with exponential growth have huge values for n &gt; 30 already. So if you want to compute all the subsets of an array, you should know that you can only do this on small arrays</code></pre>

<p>• Arrays are great containers when we need to access elements based on their position. They provide constant-time access to any element, and we can read or write any element without sequentially accessing the elements before it.</p>
<p>• However, arrays are inherently static. That is, because of the way they are implemented in memory, their size cannot be changed once they are created.</p>
<p>• Having a fixed-size container means that we can’t be flexible if we find that we need to store more elements. Furthermore, allocating a large array from the start to support the largest possible number of elements is often a waste of memory.</p>
<p>• Dynamic arrays are a way to get the best of arrays and add some flexibility. They are not a different type of data structure. They use fixed-size arrays but add a strategy to grow and shrink them as needed, reallocating the underlying static array each time it needs to be resized.</p>
<p>• The best strategy for dynamic arrays is to double the size of the underlying static array when we try to insert a new element into a full array and halve the size of the array when, after removing an element, three-quarters of the elements are empty</p>
<p>• This flexibility comes at a cost: insert and delete can’t be constant time as they are for static unsorted arrays. But for the insert method (and, under some assumptions, for the delete method as well), we can guarantee that n operations take an O(n) amortized running time and additional memor</p>

<ol type="1">
<li>Negative indexing : allow negative indexing</li>
<li>Right rotation: function that shifts every element 1 step toward the right and the rightmost element goes to the first index</li>
<li>Left rotation : that same as right rotation but to the left</li>
<li>right rotation with steps: how to implement big numbers like 1e5 right rotation in efficient way</li>
<li>pop a position: take the idx of element and return the index of it and delete it from the array no new memory creation and code is very efficient if the removed element is the last one</li>
<li>Improved search : each time you find the value in an array shift it one step to the left</li>
<li>2D Array : creat a fixed grid of requested rows and columns</li>
